"This place is nothing short of astounding.  I went in for my first Brazilian and decided to get a blow-out as well.  These women are incredible in every way, from their work to their personalities. I've never felt more comfortable and relaxed under such intimidating circumstances (THANKS JENNE!).  Oh, and they're both comedians, so be ready to laugh the whole time you're here :)  Can not wait to go back!",5,5
"I received a haircut from Taneaka today and I had a wonderful experience. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, it did takelonger than I expected but I appreciate the care that Taneaka and her instructor spent on my simple trim. I got one of the best haircuts I have ever had. And Taneaka was very pleasant and fun to talk to as well. I am definitely going back.",5,5
"Drive from Fort Campbell, Ky to this place every other weekend .
Love the place, many TVs to watch a game on, full bar , great Hookah, good Ma`sell ( molasses-hookah...), natural coal not the one that burn your throat, have it with some mint tea and you my friend on nice journey ..lol... would recommend  it to the new to hookah and to  the old timers.",4,5
"Fabulous Sunday brunch! Very kid friendly, vanilla lemonade delicious and everything fresh. Friendly service. We will be back!",5,5
"I love this place. Been coming here for almost 20 years. If you want good boiled or fried seafood in an extremely casual no frills atmosphere, this place is a safe bet. The raw oysters here are always very fresh and reasonably priced. The service is good if a bit rushed at times (the place is small and gets VERY busy). Not the place to go to impress a first date or before a night at the theatre, but perfect before enjoying a night out at Mardi Gras or after a long day of Jazzfest.",4,5
"Would I come here again? Probably. I'd give it another shot and try flour tortillas with chicken for my tacos this time though. The corn tortillas are thick, so thick they kind of fall apart when you're eating your tacos. I felt like the taste of the corn over powered the meat. I had carne asada tacos, the meat was ok quality, I got a lot of gristle which wasn't the greatest. The rice, beans and horchata were all A+. Be warned, the chili they serve here is really, really hot. Normally I love hot chili/salsa, but this one kind of left my mouth numb and it didn't really have a flavor.",3,3
"Freaky fast as always.  Got the JJ Gargantuan and it was made within 3 minutes.  Barely had time to fill my own drink.  Love the new location with this Jimmy John's.  It is clean, the associates are very friendly (greeting me on the way in and on the way out) and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat.  I am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of I-465 and by many work places.  My only regret...I forgot to get a pickle!",5,5
"The line can be intimidating, but moves pretty fast. The pancakes are the bomb. I love pancakes I thought it was worth it. I went on a busy Saturday and my group of 5 waited in line, sat down and finished our food in maybe less than 2 hours, probably less than that. The coffee wasn't great, but lets be honest I was there for the chocolate chip pancakes.",4,4
"I wish there was more seating but what're you gonna do! Haha

Friendly staff, and huge portions.

So yummy! Love the scrambles and burritos. The French toast was amazing for real too!",4,5
Love this place!  Been going back once a week for the past two years.  There is usually a wait but the line moves quickly and have never had a bad sandwich.,5,5
"The food is not really authentically Mexican. I liked the cute idea of the little doll to put under your pillow to scare bad dreams away, not sure it is related to the Mexican culture though. I was hoping for something truly Mexican. The service was just ok, not too knowledgeable about their food items.",2,2
"Beer Garden Review If you are looking for a casual evening with some beer and your basic pizza and fries this is it! The pizza has better crust than lariele! They have created a great cozy outdoor environment in the beer garden. I just wish they had more draft beers and more pizza options but hopefully those are coming. The service was not great, waitress seemed annoyed and took a while to come back to table. The arancini was eh. You are served with plastic plates and forks so definitely a casual setting!",4,3
"Charcoal grill ""pre apps"" are a nice touch. The quail paired nicely with a bourbon, the mushrooms not so much.  They were good otherwise.

My wife and I shared a baby leaf greens salad and the Cornish hen and succotash.  It was delicious.  

The ambiance on the lower level is mediocre, but the acoustic guitarist was a nice touch.  Head upstairs to enjoy some louder music and hang out for a bit.  The decor is much more authentic.

Will return again , but with friends.",3,4
"For all the hype and build-up I received about Luke, it was a little bit of a let down. I had the wienerschnitzel and my friend had the shrimp and grits. My pork was pounded thin and cooked well. It was pretty tender, the panko crust was golden and crispy but could have used a bit of flavor. The wild mushroom ragout was a little lack luster. It tasted heavily of sherry, but had almost nothing else going for it besides a heap full of really amazing wild mushrooms (which was redeeming). The fries are shoestring and thin, and really tasty when they're piping hot, but stale quickly and then get kind of hard and yucky. My friend had the shrimp and grits, which was good, but overly rich even for a typically overly rich dish. We had a beyond amazing meal the next day at Commander's for the same price. Wouldn't do it again. I do, however, hear that their happy hour is great! Good oysters, their raw bar seemed on point.",2,3
"My guy and I recently started Paleo. After hearing amazing reviews from friends that whose culinary judgement we trust, we decided our last hurrah breakfast was going to be here. We were honestly overwhelmed with our choices and had no idea which route to take. So - he got the breakfast Mexican Sandwich and I got the Biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. We also both got a small mimosa. 

Let's start with the mimosa. It was really good, but honestly - it's the size of 3 normal mimosas. And it's served with ice... interesting. Not bad - just interesting. 

I tried his breakfast Mexican sandwich. The bread... Ohhhh the bread. It was the better choice of our two selections. Very flavorful and the bread is just - well it's almost croissant like. Almost.

The biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. Let's start with the gravy. If you choose the spicy option - it just has a little kick. Not a dropkick - so don't be skurrd. It's called the biscuit skillet, but honestly - I detected not one single bite of biscuit. Maybe they crumbled it up for me into teeny tiny little biscuit bits. I don't know. It was basically a skillet full of tasty slop, but I probably won't get it again.

The atmosphere: We went in on a Sunday for brunch so it was crowded. One of the first things we noticed was that their ""outside seating"" was in the parking lot. No - like... REALLY the parking lot. Just seemed less than restaurant-y. Kind of grimy and dirty... but you get the choice as to whether you want to sit out there or not, so I didn't mark down for that.

When we walked inside to wait - there was definitely a line and a LOT of confusion. There was no one taking names, waitresses and host were seating people. We did get seated rather quickly, but there was a lot of apologizing and shifting as we hovered over the table next to the front door.

I'm sure we'll be back at some point - but there was a lot of hype to build this place up and in my opinion, it was good.... Just not OMG!!!",3,3
"I work nearby and get food from them about once a week. Everything I have gotten has been tasty and well made, and the prices are very reasonable. I generally get take-out, but there are some tables to sit inside as well.",4,5
"First of all, I have mixed hair, which can be tricky when trying to find a good hairdresser. I went there today, very nervous in order to get a blow out and a trim. Eric was my hairdresser and all I can say is that he is AMAZING! My hair is silky and straight! I will definitely go back!",5,5
"The ineptitude of this company has reached epic proportions.  I will not go into details because I have already spent too many hours of my life mired in the colossal sea of incompetence that is Express Scripts.  If you have any choice at all, do not, DO NOT use this company.",1,1
"Where to start...Darin is awesome! Him and his team (our driver Ron) did an amazing job hosting our group through the different wineries. We could not decide on specific places so we put our trust in Darin and he totally hooked us up!

My group had an absolute blast on the trip (killer sound system, cold waters available, good vibes).

I would 100% recommend JOTSB so anyone traveling to Santa Barbara for some good wine.",5,5
I would give this place zero stars if I could. They advertise 2 paddle boards and all year only one paddle board and no paddle. Filthy conditions.  When u contact front desk they say management will call u but they don't. Units are not clean when students move in.  They allow animals. Configuration of the apartment is horrible. Like living in a cell block. Kitchen is too small. Not enough area for food prep or dish storage.   They put on a good show when students are checking the place out but it is bait and switch. Don't rent here,1,1
Wish there was an option for ONE STAR. An epic disappointment on my wedding weekend. To be continued...,1,1
"A pleasure to deal with and a wonderful job turning 3 old basses that I had never been able to get quite right into truly enjoyable instruments. Turns out two had necks that were less than straight. New and level frets and nut, flat neck and sweet low action, both now play like a dream.",5,5
"Had the most delicious meal here last night! We reserved a room and it was so fun! We ordered Sushi, Hibachi, and Pad Thai. Every single thing we ate was delicious! The jalapeño yellowtale  was my personal favorite and the Filet Mignon Hibachi was to die for!",5,5
Awsome indian food. Dosas are great. Don't miss the ginger chicken. I also love their parathas. One lamb curry with an order of paratha (2 pcs) and the complimentary rice can easily serve 2 if you've had an appetizer.,5,5
"Henry's reminds me of a coffee shop you'd pop into in a little town on the East Coast before walking 5 more steps to the beach. It is quaint, welcoming and inviting, so naturally that makes me think of vacation. 

The food is delicious - and there's quite a variety of breakfast and lunch choices available at all times, as well as brunch options on the weekend. A chicken Caesar wrap at 10:30 am? Sure, no problem at Henry's. They also have a decent amount of baked goods to choose from. 

I had an Arnold Palmer to drink, since I wasn't feeling coffee on this particular day, and that was great and refreshing. I glanced at the drink menu and overall thought those prices were pretty high. So, overall, impressed with the food prices and think those are a great value, but feel the price point on the coffee is a little high.

I still think I would give their coffee a shot, as this is a cute and quiet place to get work done or catch up with friends. I'll definitely be back.

Ease of parking on East Street, also a plus.",4,5
Fantastic food! Had the very vegan pizza and it was delicious! This place has a wide selection of healthy menu options. Highly recommend this pizza place!,5,5
"Jean is as good as it gets. She is one of a kind who really cares that you think your hair looks great. It has been a long time since I found a stylist that made me happy I had come to them.  If I could give her ten stars here, I would!",5,5
"The breakfast burrito was amazing! All the ingredients tasted fresh and my meal wA flavor packed. I got the apple, carrot, and orange juice as well and it was delish!",5,5
"Some of the best food I've had in Florida. Scallops are perfect as is the grouper.  Great food, great drinks and great atmosphere on the water!",5,5
"My fault for not inspecting the meal I bought (2 breast of chicken) worth 6.52 basically gave me 1 breast of chicken by cutting 1/4 of the breast and saying that it's 2 breast. By the time I was home I didn't want to drive back and explain myself. Also their phone is out of service. I'm not sure this place will last long, it's always empty and theirs better options. I'm from Miami and the Pollo Tropicals over there are 20 times better. 

Go somewhere else, this place is pitiful.",1,1
"the best Taiwanese food you can get in Reno. No comparison to larger cities with a bigger Asian population but in Reno, this is the best you can get.",5,4
yr so nashville if ... you wait in line for an hour to eat pancakes,2,5
"Service was great - friendly and quick. Gumbo Ya-Ya was excellent! Very consistant, easy parking.",4,5
"My new favorite vegan restaurant in the SB and Montecito area. We are sorely lacking in high quality vegan food that is more than just salads- and now Olivers is helping mend that problem! My partner and I came here and had the avo toast, the potato wedges with AMAZING green garlic sauce, the squash ravioli, the mushroom taco plate, and the chocolate torte. It was all absolutely delish! 

Service was great and the decor/ambience is lovely. Beautiful patio and nice bar. 

We will definitely be back to Olivers! Thanks for making veganism an even easier choice!",5,5
"The anticipation of Milk & Honey has been building for literally years, and they finally opened with a lackluster impression. 
We came in for lunch and they did an excellent job with the space. It's very pretty and open with great design. 
Our waitress seemed a bit spacey and knew hardly anything about the menu, but it was only their second day open so I try to give some slack for new restaurants. However, she really should have been able to speak to the menu. We started off with the pastrami poutine and it was good but very rich. However, it was a good dish if you are wanting something substantial. Unfortunately that's about where the good ended. 
I had the turkey and brie sandwich with kale salad, and my BF had the fried chicken sandwich with farro salad. 
My turkey sandwich was not good. It came with fig jam that was way too much jam and leaked onto the outside which made my hands extremely sticky. Overall it was heavy and the flavors didn't meld together at all. The kale salad had too much dressing on it and the fried chicken sandwich was bland. I enjoyed the farro salad at least. My latte was good, but small and the honey latte was way too sweet, but I guess that comes with the order. 
The menu was promising and I was so excited for this place to open, but it was a let down after two years of waiting.",2,2
"We have always loved tangelo's the food is exceptional. Today, we had not only delicious sandwiches for brunch, but service that went above and beyond. We had two young kids with us and after spending the morning at the beach they were both a little cranky. Our server brought them coloring books, and when she notice our two year old asking over and over for his waffle that we ordered, she brought him a small fruit plate to hold him over. After he ate it up I took him outside while we waited for the food and another server saw him looking still a little grouchy and brought out some bubbles to blow with him. It is easy to get frustrated with whiny kids at restaurant, but this staff went waaaaaaaaay above and beyond to make my kids (and the rest of us) happy. While we were there we also saw them bring out a dog bed for a patron with a service dog. I just cannot say enough good things. Thanks tangelo's for being awesome.",5,5
"Very dated, not very clean and not kept up. Antiseptic smell. Would not stay there again. Parking is cumbersome.",2,1
"Ok, this place is amazing.  Beyond the unsuspecting strip mall is this whimsical, serene sanctuary with a Parisian flair.  I mean, the decor looks like something that would have it's own show on HGTV.  So, right away you start to relax.  Then you've got amazing staff, from the front desk to the aestheticians.  

I went one time to try it out and accidentally on purpose bought the monthly massage membership.  It's worth it.

You get into your comfy robe, grab a handful of chocolates and head to the relaxation room where you are treated to either in infused water, hot tea or wine (you guessed it... I usually have the wine).  Then, you're whisked away to one of those magical rooms for whatever treatment you...well... treated yourself to.  After your massage is over (you wish it wasn't), you can take a shower and try out some of their sample products.  Then, you step back out into the real world feeling totally refreshed.

You'll love it, I promise.",5,5
"Great restaurant, fun vibe and creative thoughtful menu.  I have been here a few times now and after reading several of the reviews, especially from those who have only been there once, I am amazed at how critical people can be. The atmosphere is a bit on the loud side, but what do you expect when your in a fun open setting.  That makes it all the more interesting.  If I wanted quiet, I would have stayed home.  The booths are my favorite, big and comfortable with enough space for a large party and still with elbow room to eat. Our booth was an awesome spot to do the south tampa people watch, and what a scene it is!  Loved that I could meld into the beautiful woodwork and enjoy.  Our dinner was exceptionally enjoyable from the time the host greeted us to when our waiter wished a safe ride home.  

Stating with the wines by the glass, smart to have Italian choices.  I tend to be a creature of habit so to not sway too far off my normal Sonoma Chardonnay they offered me a delicious Il Borro white.  Smooth and refreshing, loved it. Also the wine glasses themselves have a clever design that allows each glass to breath.  I thought there was a crack in the glass but when the owner stopped by to say hello, he explained how they work and swirled my husbands red.  The attention to detail is truly amazing and I haven't even gotten to the food.  We had the luxury of asking the owner bit more about the menu and he went on to share with us how each morning the bread is kneaded and baked in the wood oven, and that each of the cavatelli pastas are hand rolled.  Reminded me of my great Italian aunts' pasta dishes.  I had to order both!  And I wasn't disappointed, it brought me back.  The pasta was tender and flavorful and the sauce was fresh and simple.  Not overbearing and heavy.  The perfect balance and the right amount.  So tired of the large oversized portions.  The table also ordered the muscles with more of the scrumptious bread.  While I am not a muscles person, I could have devoured the sauce by myself. Along with the smokey flavor of the bread dipped in the sauce, the combination was heaven.  Another guest with us had the Kale Salad and the meatballs.  Wow another great combo choice.  Love the Kale in the tempura batter, crispy, tangy and spectacular.  And the meatballs, something I have been known to make mean one myself, were presented by themselves with no sauce.  Very daring since a meatball without sauce better be pretty darn good.  Again they were flavorful, and spices used were the right amount to complement the meat.  Our daughter ordered the margherita pizza and loved the flavor of the crust but would have liked a bit more cheese.  (and what kid wouldn't like more).  Anyway it was definitely reminiscent of the pizzas we had in Italy, so again kudos to the authenticity of everything Ava's is doing.  

Yes I'm a fan! See you at Ava's soon.",4,5
"Perhaps I'm a bit jaded right now as I am applying to Grad Schools for my MBA, but IUPUI charges you $10 to send your transcripts to other schools. So every school I want to apply to, not only do I have to pay their application fee, but then I have to give IUPUI $10 for every transcript. As if I didn't give them enough money throughout my 4 years in undergrad, they want to gouge you for as much money as humanly possible. Many of my other colleagues that are applying to Grad Schools don'
t have this issue. Their colleges send their transcripts free of charge. Must be nice...",3,1
"If you're traveling through the Indianapolis area (because, let's face it, why would you be traveling TO Indianapolis ;), plan on stopping here!  

I knew I'd be driving from Denver to Maryland and was scoping out some places to eat along the way.  Reviews on other websites convinced me that I HAD to eat here -- I wasn't disappointed!  The fried chicken was the best I've had, by far.  The mac and cheese wasn't but was still very good.  But if and when I come back, it will be for the desserts.  The selection is amazing!  About half of the entire line is devoted to various cakes, pies, puddings, ice cream, etc. I'm bummed that I only selected one (the butterscotch pie, which was really good).

Here's how it works: get in line and grab a tray and utensils.  Desserts are displayed first and since you can't actually see far enough down the display case to see all the desserts and make a proper decision, you'll probably want to select your favorite from the first half and then another favorite from the second half.  Next, you select your meat then sides (as many as you can handle).  Dinner rolls and drinks are last.  You pay on a per-item basis.  Waitresses refill your drinks.

I didn't see the hours posted on their website but I believe it was something like 11am to 9pm, 7-days a week.  Next time I'm passing through Indianapolis, I'll definitely be stopping here.  I might even plan on going TO Indianapolis just so I can eat here again...

Were there a lot of ""elderly people""?  Who knows?  I was too busy enjoying my dessert!",5,5
"So amazing! Had the dragon cello ravioli vegetarian pasta and it was amazing! However, my boyfriend had the gnocchi in a red sauce and I was stealing off his plate more, so the gnocchi was definitely top 5 of best I've ever had! The NY cheesecake was great as well - perfect for 2 people. Great atmosphere and server was polite and friendly. Took a little longer to get our server to table but happy with end result. Chairs could be better as I was sitting behind a bigger male and he kept hitting my chair. However it was amazing food!",5,5
"How did this restaurant disappoint, let me count the ways. First, they ""lost"" our name on the wait list. Not a good start. As we waiting to order, we pondered what this restaurant was trying to be. It's Sunday after 3, the sound system is blaring dance music. We can barely talk to each other. There are many tv's showing a variety of sports shows. The waitresses is revealing is her navel. What is this place trying to be? Not a destination location for fine food. My eggs benni was mediocre. The eggs and sauce were nice, the English muffin, not toasted and soggy. And the potatoes(?)' Savory white and mashed sweet potatoes. Not a good pairing for breakfast. All in all, I leave poorer, and still hungry. Seek alternate routes",2,2
"My experience with this truck is mixed.  Veg couscous seemed healthy but was pretty bland. Smoked salmon sandwich (with egg, radish, caviar) was great.

Service can be very slow at times -- sometimes he chats for extended periods with certain people.",4,3
"I came for the buffet which is advertised in the window for $7.99.  However, there was a sandwich board on the street saying it was $6.99.   At either price, it's a great deal.   There are a lot of your standard Indian buffet entrees.   What makes this place great is the bread that they bring to your table.  Order it plain or garlic and tell them to keep it coming.",3,4
"Really should've read reviews before coming here but it's the only one I remembered being open on Sunday. Service was horrible. Was quickly sat for pedicure but it lasted like 20 mins n that's including polish! I usually go somewhere else but unfortunately they were closed. The lady was rough!! Had to give her a few looks before she caught herself! I should've have to tell ppl not to brush my skin with a brush that's for nails!!! 

Hadn't been here in years n now I remember y!! They don't even have the separators that goes between the toes. She used paper towel! I don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself! Mani/pedis r supposed to be relaxing!! This was a complete nightmare. I'm surprised they are still opened!!",1,1
The new space is beautiful and relaxing.  I have been seeing Monika for my facials for a few years and she is great.  Gives advice and recommendations and has great attention to detail.  Fantastic skin care products for sale at the spa and she will help you customize what is best for you.,5,5
"Burger Study
28 W Georgia St, Indianapolis, IN 46225
Visit Date: Nov 9, 2017

I stopped in at the new Burger Study restaurant located off Georgia Street. There is also an entrance that connects it to the Circle Center mall. When you walk in it is themed like an old study might be. It is not an over-the-top theme though. I sat at the bar and Roxanne was my server. She was extremely friendly and took great care of me. I ordered the Homecoming Burger which is topped with thick cut, root beer glazed bacon and smoked Gouda cheese as its unique toppings. I was not there for the lunch rush but the food came out pretty quickly. Overall the taste was really good. The flavors of the cheese, bacon, and burger blended together well. The patty was good but not the best I have ever had. (Note: They do have a few higher end patties but I chose to go with the most common for my first visit. All of the sides are a la carte which can increase your ticket price pretty quickly. I opted to go with the zucchini straws which were deep fried in a light batter. The zucchini straws were delightful with the accompanying dipping sauce. Overall I would recommend and visit The Burger Study again.

Rating: 6.8",3,4
Excellent food and price ^_^ .... The place is all but coZy .... Waiter was nice ....I would definitely come back again,5,5
Cute place. Has smoothies where you choose what you want and what fruits. They also have ice cream and soft serve where you can add toppings. There was even a chocolate rocks topping where I haven't seen since I was a kid. I got a soft serve smoothie with mango and strawberry. The regular size is about 16 ounces I want to say...,4,5
"Pros: 
-I was able to visit the French Quarters. 

Cons: 
-My catfish royale tasted more like a perfume than actual fish.
-The ""show"" dish was nothing but false advertisement. 
-The deep fried crawfish was less than a child's handful of crawfish tail meat that was on top of a large bed of spring mix. 
-The girl handling the register and taking orders not only went to the back to touch her hair, but also touch my food with her bare hands. 

Never again.",1,1
Went here twice before for lunch special to do take out. The food tasted horrible and mine and hubby's rice was like filled half way in the container. I personally like going to Philadelphia China town when I can.,2,2
"This is not a bad review just a suggestion to the restaurant. When I filtered ""delivery"" and ""open now"" you guys came up so I looked at the menu, called, and was told that you were not doing delivery's anymore. As I said, not a bad review, just a heads up.",4,3
"So disappointed.   Brought a friend from out of town there because I heard it was great..... horrible all the way around.   Cold air from floor vents  the Tom Kai, bland at best. The muscles small, over cooked and cold.  But worst they had me running for a bathroom an hour later.   Totally got sick from it.  :/  still sick from it.    Please do yourself a favor don't eat here.  Thai Phooket 1000 times better and half the price.",1,1
"This is my favorite restaurant in st. Pete at the moment. The cocktails are creative and fantastic the food is wonderful. I've tried almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed. I highly recommend the steak tartare to start, the curry as the main and the espresso martini to drink.",5,5
"This is the best Szechuan food I have had in Philadelphia. I have tried the Dan Dan noodles, the garlic chicken, the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and the long hot pepper chicken.  The garlic chicken and long hot pepper chicken were not as spicy as I would have liked, but they were only rated a 3 for spicy, and next time I would just ask for some chili oil on the side. The Dan Dan noodles are rated a 8, and that is as spicy as I can handle.",5,5
"This place is delish!  

We ate here on a Sunday for lunch after touring Fonthill mansion.  Picked it based on the great yelp! reviews, and it was as good as others said!

The quesadilla that I had (anita's?) was probably the best quesadilla I ever have eaten. Filled with pulled pork, avocado, and cheese, absolutely yummy! My husband loved his cubano sandwich.

Service was friendly and prompt. Order and pay at the counter, then food is brought to your table.

Highly recommend, and I would return if in the area again!",4,5
Great experience stopping in in a hurry for vape juice. They matched me up with a good locally made product that fit my taste. They really know their products and are super friendly!,5,5
"It only took me about 2 minutes inside Bar 23 to realize this bar was trying way too hard to be hip. The upstairs lounge is the only part that actually is cool, but it's almost always closed off.  

I had written this place off, but then VBS, the weekly dance parties DJd by Justin Kase started there so I was peer-pressured into giving it another chance.  On those nights they have $3 wells till 11 so that's a great feature.  The last time I went though my dancing was hampered by the sticky evil that attached to my shoes. Apparently the glue was coming off the floor in the seating sections, and once you had been in it for a while your shoes stuck to the floor all night.

So if you ever think to yourself should I go to Bar 23 and check out the scene, unless the day is Thursday the answer is ""no.""  Even then, be prepared for the crowd to be the young hipster set mixed with shiny Vandy candy and their boys. Lately I've been hearing rumor that Bar 23 is giving up their lease along with a few other Gulch businesses such as Adagio to make room for Urban Outfitters. I don't think anyone will miss it since they can get the same atmosphere done better in at least 5 other bars in town.",2,2
"It's a really big dive bar with a huge seating room, tons of pool tables (one with a dedicated smoking room), and a patio. Manages to avoid the typical douchiness that tends to follow billiards rooms and the service is good.",4,4
"WOW!! This place is not your ordinary fast food restaurant. You can come in and sit down to dine in, order take out or enjoy yourself during happy hour at the bar. Well I decided to order takeout and sit at the bar during happy hour while I wait for my food. The happy hour beers are a good value, I got a nice cheap beer for $2.20 from a very friendly bartender/server. As for the burger I ordered the 'Fire Quacker' it's made of duck, added to pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapenos on a brioche bun. This 'burger' was juicy, tender and bursting with flavor. No it's not your traditional burger but if you are adventurous you should take a shot. I also ordered the onion rings, nothing to really speak of here. If they're 'homemade' they should rethink the recipe as the taste is bland and overly breaded.",4,4
"I cannot say enough about hotel Monaco.  The decor is modern yet cozy, the staff is more than accommodating, the Red Owl restaurant is the perfect hotel bar/restaurant and there's a cool roof top lounge... Everything you need under one roof!  It's literally across the street from the Liberty Bell, steps from Market Street and a few doors down from Buddakan.  I've stayed here twice in the past month and can't wait to go back!  

And did I mention that the beds are beyond comfortable?!  Stay here, you'll thank me later",5,5
nothing short of awesome.  forgot i was in philly... totally feels like 300 sqft imported from NYC.  crispy chik'n ranch sandwich was HOT and CRISPY with fresh (cool) tomatoes & lettuce.  great contrast in a little sandwich.  mmmmm  happy vegan.,5,5
"Excellent food, friendly staff, warm atmosphere in cozy room.  Wish we had places like this in DC.  And BYOB in addition?  Perfect.",5,5

Everything was I asked for chicken on my pasta no chicken told him forget it since I was so starved my fault skipped breakfast won't come back unless it's a family thing and I don't get a say I don't like to give bad reviews I know that waiting tables is hard I have done it but this lunch sucked it wasn't busy enough to justify crap service",1,1
"The best coffee and the best eggs, toast and avocado. Try the Munster sandwich it's really yummy. And the biscuit and honey is a must. Yummy all the way.",5,5
"A great place for a Saturday outing.  In the heart of downtown! There were multiple  races for cyclists of all ages, a parade of all kinds of decorated bicycles, food,  beer, a wine truck, giveaways and much more.  I signed up for the NIGHT Race which STARTS AT 11 PM from City Market It's a 20 mile ride which includes downtown, the Children's Museum,  CROWN HILL, Art Museum, Hinkle and much more! I even purchased one of the glow in the dark shirts! t's going to be a fun end to a great day! Time to take a nap before it starts!",5,5
"I've read the reviews and have lived near this place since 2000 so we went in last night to finally try it out.  Is this a locals place?  Of course it is.  Is it full of repeat customers?  Of course it is.  The place is laid back and easy going where everyone just blends in.  If you looking for pampered service with expertly timed service or believe you need to be hovered over by the staff....you will not be and I would recommend you go elsewhere because thats not the vibe.  Plan on going in to just hang out, be chill and enjoy the place where you can just have a couple of drinks and some great burgers. 

Rachel was our server who directed us the burgers and highlighted the top items on the menu. She was friendly with a level of honesty and good sense of humor. She was one busy girl hustling from room to room and across the bar.  This is hard work and she kept us taken care of. Job well done Rachel and we appreciated it.  We'll be back for sure.",4,5
"Great little spot, tasty happy hour menu, good tunes, nice beer list...enjoy! We stopped by for a Friday happy hour and it was pretty quiet. If you're looking for a place to catch ur breath after a long week this space t should do the trick.",5,5
"Yum!  I've visited The Hot Spot a few times now over the weekend at the Elmington Park gathering & boy do they have some tasty, spicy food!

If you can handle it, I recommend the hot burger.  They're a little smaller than the average burger, so 2 may be in order.  Just make sure you have some milk nearby.  The burger comes covered in jalapeños,  cheese, and more.  The fries are pretty tasty as well if you want something that won't set your mouth alight.  The dessert list seems to vary, but they're always quite tasty - that is if you have taste buds left.

(This is a food truck, remember, so you'll have to look up online where they'll be parked for the day)",4,5
"Had lunch here the other day, and it's time to bump Joey up to a four.  The service is always friendly, the portions are hearty and the food is more flavorful then most sports themed bars. 

We started our lunch with some Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings. They defiantly are H&S, but not that big & meaty.  Next time I want to try their Butter Garlic wings - they just sound Paula Deen good. 

I had their Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and it was better then Johnson's Corner in Alton and they are known for theirs.  It was huge, it hung off the bun in all directions.  The tenderloin was breaded, crispy and oh so tender when bitten into. It was so full of flavor, I didn't even use any of the sauce they provided. I am such a naturalist. 

Brad had the Crispy Chicken Salad and it was huge. Romaine lettuce, Breaded Boneless Chicken, Cheddar Cheese (no Provel), Green Onion, Bacon and Tomato with Honey Mustard. Salad was acceptable, could have been better if they didn't use bacon that came from a bag. Fresh bacon would made it pop so much more.  The salad was so huge that  two could have shared.  Brad didn't even finish it, however I finished my sandwich. 

What made my most recent visit enjoyable was watching the other diners. 
It was fun to watch the interchange between the ""career girls"" and their Uncles and Dads while they seemed to be having a ""working lunch"".  The bond with a dad is so magical.",4,4
"Sandwich Service is very slow. Sandwiches are not consistent, always different when ordering the same thing. They always have one cashier during rush hours. This Wawa is very busy, why not have more employees working sandwiches and cashier?!",2,2
"What a great night! We did the Central Bank room with a group of friends for my husband's birthday and it could not have been more fun. Well organized, the attention to detail in the room was amazing and the personalized attention by the husband and wife owners was awesome. We can't wait to go back to try the Zombie room. The location is perfect to grab dinner and drinks before or after (or both!) and parking was convenient. I highly recommend Fox in a Box!",5,5
Food was just mediocre. Nothing was hot just warm. We are not beer drinkers so probably not a great place if you prefer wine.,3,3
"Well, I have been visiting Arner's for many years, but had been out of state for a few years now.  Their salad bar was one to come visit with their homemade bread with whipped butter that you slice yourself.  NOPE none -- some (you can get anywhere) rolls were in their place.  Salad bar was ok.  Now let us talk desserts,  I love lemon meringue pie.   Big piece of pie, but the filling if homemade they need to fire the baker! OMG  lumpy lemon pie??!!!!????  New Owners? don't know.  Is this why we did not wait in a long line, which was par the course for this restaurant?",1,2
Found this little spot on an off night. Cozy place to grab a beer and sit by the fire. You could bring some board games and hang out in the great room. Small pub menu makes choosing some lite fare easy. If you like chess there is a large outdoor set that would be fun in spring or summer.,4,4
"I went to the Campbell House Museum a couple of days ago to see what it was all about. I had heard about from a couple of friends and they all spoke about how it was interesting and everything like that, so I went and checked it out.

After going to the Campbell House I figured that if you want an idea what old St. Louis might have been like, then looking at this house and how people lived is pretty much the way to go. Of course, the way of life for these people was the life of the rich, so I wouldn't say it gives an insight to the life of everybody, just the rich.

Walking around inside of the house was very neat. I always enjoy looking at old classic things and the way in which people lived and things of the olden days. That would be the history buff, nerd, whatever you want to call it coming out of me.

The Campbell House Museum is very interesting and seeing the old furniture very fascinating.",4,4
"I went there alone so there wasn't any wait time for me. I was able to walk right in and have a seat at the bar. I was greeted promptly and was provided with a glass of water before I could even say hello. After the pleasantries, I was given a menu and the bartender didn't hesitate to inform me of the specials for the day, and even specific details about certain menu items because it was my first time there. I ordered a cocktail and two food items and everything came out great!! The food was delicious and the cocktail had just the right amount of liquor so it wasn't too strong, but it was still tasteful. My overall experience at Village Whiskey was awesome!! I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking to dine & drink in center city.",5,5
DELICIOUS pizza!! Loved the video games and the huge bathroom. Will be back for sure.,5,5
"Great food and margaritas. The menu is a bit difficult to navigate, but we loved everything we ordered. The el sabor menu was a great deal. Homemade Guacamole for the table, a choice of appetizer and an entree for $29. Based off the entree prices it really is a fabulous bargain. The atmosphere is quiet and not as ""fun"" and lively as promised. It was a good quiet spot to go with friends.",3,4
"Fabulous concept. Had a 3 hour layover and saw the word Spa and it brought a smile to my face. Yeah!!! The service menu is a little confusing - I take that back - it is very confusing! You will understand why at the end. Ok, so I said, how about a 20 minute foot massage and a mini-facial. I sign the log book and give them my cell phone number. They will call me when a ""slot"" opens. Waited about 15 minutes in one of their empty recliner/massage chairs. Actually very nice. A gentlemen comes over and turns on the recliner massager and starts massaging my feet. Actually very nice. Another gentlemen comes over and starts to place some soothing pads on my face and asks ""Do you want the collagen eye pads?"" - I said, ""OK, sure"". Thinking that he was asking if it was ok to place pads on my eyes. There are soothing pads on my face and eyes. He then massages my face (on top of the pads) and neck and arms and upper shoulders. He then removes the pads. I was in the chair a total of 30 minutes for the foot massage and mini-facial. I was actually relaxed and it was nice. Now here comes the ""problem"". The gentleman that did my facial tallies up the bill. $40 for a 20-minute foot massage. $40 for a Collagen Full Face Mask AND another $30 for Collagen Eye Mask. Hmmmmm $110 for 30 minutes. I was prepared to pay $70 plus tip - I was not prepared to pay $110 plus tip. This spa is a very nice concept and I will use it again. But please be careful about the prices and services. Ask about detailed pricing before the services are performed. I am giving 2 stars because the facial gentlemen clearly knew that he was misleading me with that $30 collagen eye add-on.

UPDATE: I have always said that if the Company Customer Service Department is exceptional, that is a true reflection of the.core of the company itself.
ExpresSpa gets 5 Stars for their Customer Service Department. I was contacted and they wanted to know all of the details so that they could put new training in place to prevent my situation from happening again. They were truly apologetic that this happened. Now that is customer focus at its best. Kudos to ExpresSpa and Betsy at Customer Service. You now have a valued customer and I will step into your oasis on my travels again! I did truly enjoy the foot massage and the facial - the staff was very nice. The place is small, and lots of people walking by, but you are in an airport, what do you expect? With that in mind, and the resolution of my experience, I would say that I am a fan, and would be delighted to use their services again when I am in an airport and have extra time.",3,5
"I really love Honey's. Ive only been here once and it happened to be a Thursday morning, so no wait. 

The service was GREAT. Like as in 30% tip great. I fell in love with the biscuits and blueberry preserves. 

Portions are huge and wonderfully yummy. I want to go back but I refuse to wait in line for breakfast on a weekend. So as soon as I get a weekday off, I will be right back at honey's.",4,5
"The food at Red Piano is ok, but definitely over priced. I had the filet mignon, the steak was fine but the potato and brussels sprouts  which came with it were extremely salty. The general consensus from those with us was the same, for what you pay, the food is subpar. 

We had a larger group of 12 and ended up getting seated at the back of the venue with poor view of the duelling piano show. In addition, the show started a lot later than 9pm when it was scheduled to start. Due to the late start, most of our party didn't see much of the show before leaving. 

I would recommend going for just the show and eating somewhere else beforehand. If you do plan to make dinner reservations, it's probably best to get a reservation time at or as close to the scheduled show time as possible.",2,2
"This might be the best Latin food I have ever had. I had the Relleno Combo & it was awesome! The beans & rice were delicious! If your looking for good Latin food, Red Mesa is your place. The atmosphere was dim lighting, kind of romantic, casual, & quiet. The only bad thing I have to say is.... There was a large party there in our room. They were VERY loud & getting drinker as the night went on. We hurried & ate quickly. Because they were so loud. It was bad enough other people ask to be put in the other dinner room. I just hate we don't have one in Texas. It's worth flying to eat there. 5 stars all the way!",5,5
"Mother's Day brunch was delicious! It was our first time there and it was amazing! Staff was so nice, the owner checked on us before we left. It was an all around great dining experience. I had the Stock's French Toast and it was YUMMY! Hubby had the Duck Benedict  and the duck fries and loved both!  One of the kids had the brisket quesadilla, and one had the ""remedy"" and said it was really good.  We will return for lunch/dinner next time!",5,5
"This star is just for the fact that there is poor or no signage for getting to the General Jackson boat cruise.  We were not staying at Opryland, but planned to go there and walk around and have dinner first, then go on our cruise.  We were shuttled over by our hotel, and the  drop off point had no visible signs for getting to the cruise boarding point.  No sign in the hotel atrium as far as we could see.  We then walked over to the outlet mall, as a hotel operator told me the boarding area was across from the movie theater.  I asked if there was a shuttle for visitors, and the rep said there was a shuttle for  hotel guests only.  but why not for all visitors?   No signage by the mall either.  We finally took a cab from one end of the mall to the other, and the cab driver told us where to board.",1,1
"New name.  Same old
Below average food and super slow service.  Kitchen is slow and the food is just completely blah.  Pork sandwich is about the best menu item.  Chicken parm plate is huge and the chicken tastes freezer burned.  Chips on the plate are basically crumbs.  Great beer list.",1,2
I had the best experience yet because of the service from Francisco. Not only was the food he suggested amazing but he also had a great taste for wine. He also shares a warming smile & was extremely attentive.,5,5
"Excellent food. Calamari and Tomato Bisque were superb. Interior space was exceptioanal. Pleasent, well layed out, no sense of crowding. Well lit. We did not eat on patio but it looked like it was a perfect spot for a dinner out. Hard to stand out in a neighbor full of great restaurants but this one does. Well worth a visit.",4,5
"Sajida is immensely good at what she does. I have always been happy with the alterations and sewing that she had made and done to my clothes! I would recommend her to anyone knowing they will be satisfied with the quality, time and care she puts into her work. Furthermore, she has a lovely, friendly and sincere personality that shines and makes her loved my so many.",5,5
"I was never a believer in acupuncture, after exhausting all other efforts to relieve stress and eliminate my OCD habits I reluctantly dragged myself to Dawna after finding her on the internet. 

The BEST thing I ever did, she has taken more time than my doctors trying to pinpoint my issues. I have been feeling better than I have in a long time. My OCD habits have completely diminished, so much so that my husband even noticed! 

Dawna has changed my life and that hour I spend once a week with her I look forward to all week long.  

If you are reluctant to try acupuncture, don't be....go see Dawna Ara!",5,5
"Great food for a great price. It's a small, low key diner serving simple food that they are making fresh. The parking lot is awful, but there's room. 

We both had the chocolate chip pancakes. They were fantastic!  It's easy to mess them up, but they were fluffy and had just the right amount of chocolate chips. 

Service was prompt and attentive.",4,5
"A small shop, but quite a variety of jerky. There was everything from shark to ostrich to python. The prices are a bit high but jerky usually is. Also appreciated the service, and the fact that they have vegan jerky!",5,5
"Local goodness.  I give these folks 5 stars for the taproom and 5 stars for the beer in general.  The taproom itself is a pleasant hang.  Always fun to drink the nectar where it is made.  No kitchen...but often a food truck is outside waiting to satisfy your hunger.

Bottom line:  the beer is really good.  I am partial to the Mutton Buster Brown and try to keep a growler full of it at home...but their wonderful brew is also available by the can in many around town.  Payette's beers also seem to be embraced by the local restaurant and bar scene.  I usually can find their Outlaw IPA or brown on tap.  

The brown, IPA and Pale seem to always be available.  The seasonal Saison was excellent.  I am tickled to hear that there is at least one seasonal Belgian style coming later this year.    

As a transplant from the East, I don't celebrate the hoptastic flava as much as my new friends here in the West.  But I'm told that Payette's many versions of hop forward beer are excellent.",5,5
"There is a lot of competition among clubs in Nashville, after all this is music city.  12th and Porter is a so-so club to catch a live band.  The atmosphere is alright, but I prefer some of the more notable clubs in the downtown area like Mercy lounge and the like.  I will give it this, 12th and Porter is one of the loudest venues around.  I say this because after I left my ears were ringing from the cranked up tunes .",3,3
Shellfish Co. really reminds of the crab joints I visit in Virginia--that is just about the highest compliment I can offer.,4,5
"We are from out of town and this is was our first stop in New Orleans on a Wednesday night. This bar did not take long to show us the true feel and culture of NOLA. The jazz band was awesome, the bartenders were beyond friendly/accommodating, and drinks top notch!",5,5
"Good food, horrible service. We dined in on May 10 for dinner. The hostess was so rude. No kind of greeting at all, not even a smile. Just asked how many and showed us to a small table that had chairs on one side and a shared booth on the other. We were there for a special occasion and the restaurant was about 25% full.. was about 7:30ish, so we asked politely if we could have one of the many open booths. She rolled her eyes and said they were all reserved, and we can sit on the ""booth side"" of the table, which made no sense since only 2 people could fit on that side. I knew that could not be true given that it was a weeknight and almost 8pm so I pointed to one of the smaller booths and said even that one was reserved? Another eye roll, then she said ""I mean...."" like we were being difficult by asking and said ""fine, whatever"". Clearly had a lot of attitude and was just all around rude. Once we sat our server was friendly, food came out quickly and was tasty. After that we didn't see her much and no refills on water, took forever to order dessert and get the check. I never did get my water refilled. The family next to us had to get the manager because they were sitting down so long and hadn't even been greeted. The manager was nice and was able to help them, but that shouldn't have been necessary, that serve only had 3 tables, one bring ours and by that point she wasn't even stopping by. No complaints on the food, but not worth coming in for the rude hostess and slow service. So many other options in cool springs now.",2,2
"Food was good. The service was really good. The dining room, just ok.

We asked them to make a couple new dishes and they were happy to help.",4,4
"Friendly, asked for a recommendation and was pleased by reasonable price and exceptional quality",5,5
"Had dinner here at the bar last night. Service was great, beer was good, burger  was really good. Most burgers on the menu were around $12.-13. I had the $19. St. Elmo steak burger which was worth it. 
Not many people at this place, pretty slow even for a Monday.",4,5
"Ordered takeout for the first time from Orchid Thai tonight. Im always on the hunt for good pad Thai and I read some pretty great reviews. 
My order was ready in 20 minutes and the staff was really nice. When I went to pick up my food the restaurant was empty but I'm assuming most people order takeout because there were only like 6 tables. I got the chicken pad Thai and ordered it medium spicy... y'all it's really spicy. I love the flavors - nice peanut taste but not too overpowering. Next time I will order it mild. 
The price is good - It was around 12 dollars and I was able to separate it into three meals. 
I wish I could say I will try other items on the menu but I can never seem to order anything but pad Thai! Stuck in my ways I guess. Can't wait to try it mild, might be a bit more enjoyable for me!",4,5
"found them on Yelp to meet some friends for dinner.  We had never been, but our dinner companions confirmed our choice. Dinner was excellent, and the menu quite varied. Prices were reasonable, and wine selection was good. Definitely looking forward to going back.",5,5
"Absolutely delicious, this is the best hot Matcha Green tea with white Bubbles in Philadelphia that I recommend. I have tried so many Bubbles store, but most of them were too sweet, or too light as they just used instant powder that the reason. Although Miucha took time longer than another store to make 1 cup by fresh tea, it was worthwhile for waiting.",5,5
"Thanks for the trash in my Gelato, 3 times now!

John's Water Ice is just around the corner from me and I have had their water ices and gelatos about 6 times now.  However, last night was the straw that broke my back and will drive me to Rita's from now on.  I ordered a gelato (Vanilla B-Day cake and Cherry ice) after getting 3 spoonfuls into it I started hacking-up an unidentified gelato object.  It turned out to be a soft contact lense.  This would surprise me from any other business establishment, but 2 orders ago I pulled a plastic price tag out of my mouth after a spoonful of gelato from John's Water Ice.  My first trash-in-mouth experience came in early June with a Cherry Water Ice, after I was about 1/3 of the way down I started finding a bunch of black specs in the water ice.  I pulled a few out and set them aside, they did not melt and they were not food items.  After attempting to crush them with my spoon and failing, I came to the non-scientific conclusion that it was some sort of crushed rock or plastic.  

Unless you like finding trash in your summer treats, I would avoid this place until they clean-up their act.  For me, I will walk 2 extra blocks and have a Rita's that comes free of trash.",1,1
"Good lunch special minus the lemongrass soup. The soup is just broth and fish sauce (or similar sauce) and a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of chicken. It does not really taste like Tom yum soup. The salad is simple and ok, and the massaman curry is good.",4,3
"Can always count on Felini's to be good and gotta love BYOB!
I've been several times, this time I tried their 'Surprise Salad', yes, that's what it's called on the menu. 
Delish! Little bit of a lot of items, so big and good that when my pasta came, I had it wrapped to go.",5,5
"Came hungry and left satisfied. Tuna melt with a tomato soup fit the bill on a windy and cold florida day.  When most other restaurants have a wait at international mall, you can order your food and enjoy and continue on your merry way.  Maybe I just lucked out but only waited about 5 minutes for my pager to blink and my tummy satisfied.",4,5
wonderful salsa choices and very close to what I used to get the 7 years I lived in Mazatlan! A must try if you want a good mexican meal at a good price!,4,5
I came in here for a French macaroon and it just wasn't good at all. The macaroon was very hard on the outside and the inside was just like a empty pocket. I was very disappointed but the reason why I didn't give this place a one star is because the service was very good. The girl at the front counter was very nice.,2,2
"I have been seeing Dr. King for over 10 years.  I don't think that there is a more thorough and competent doctor in the city.  She spends at least 45 minutes with me during exams, listens carefully and follows up on any potential issues.  The practice also does routine Gyn care in the office, which I find very convenient.  The only issue I have is the phone service.  They are a busy practice and you can be placed on hold for long periods of time.  That being said, I have never felt rushed during my appointments.",5,5
"It's our favorite restaurant. Delicious Vietnamese foods, there're other Asian food such as Chinese and Thai foods in the restaurant too. Plus bubble tea. We go there often.",5,5
"The food is delicious and the service is outstanding!  I have had a beef burrito, empanadas, plantains and tacos and all were very tasty. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy with your meal. Definitely try this place when you are in the neighborhood.",5,5
"I sometimes take advantage of the cheap oil change and free tire rotation, but they always coincidentally find something else wrong with my car.  Hmm? During the latest episode, I had them check my brakes during a free tire rotation, and they told me that my brake system needed a complete overhaul for over $700.  I just so happened to overhear them telling the poor gentleman in front of me that he had the exact same problem as me so, I told them no thanks.  They then proceeded to tell me that my wheels could potentially catch on fire if nothing was done, and I should park my car at home and not drive it if I didn't get it fixed that moment.  Despite the threats, I took my car and went on my way.  I drove it for a few days and decided to take it to a mechanic I trust.  They checked my brakes and assured me that nothing was wrong.  I dodged that bullet with a $30 brake check at an honest car shop.  Unfortunately, the customer prior to me did not.

PS.  I've been driving my car for months since my visit to Firestone, and my wheels still haven't caught on fire.",1,1
"This was a fun place for the most part. Day one: it was a breezy day and the water was also freezing, so less enjoyable. Day two: warmer day and warmer water. We got what we went there for and had some fun so can't complain. I wish there was more outdoor stuff.",3,4
"I loved this hotel.  Probably one of my favorites, considering the cost.  I somehow stumbled on a deal from Orbitz.com that allowed me to get a room here and a car rental from Alamo for $89.

First and foremost, the service here is EXCELLENT.  I gotta hand it to Yolanda and Danielle.  Let me just explain... I was in Philly for just one night due to an interview at Temple.  It's hard for one to gauge whether or not a city is a good fit.  Yolanda and Danielle really took the time to describe the city, the vibe, and areas to live in.  Danielle even went as far as to run out to her car and grab be an apartment guide to get an idea of cost of living in Philly.  They went above and beyond to make my stay welcome.

Secondly, if this is the same Starwood Industries as of Mammoth and Whistler Blackcomb, they did it right here at this hotel.  The #1 most important thing for me is cleanliness.  This place is one of the cleanest that I have stayed at, and I have been in a modest amount of hotels during my interview trail this year - the Cincinnati Hilton included.

The modern vibe is also neat.  The decor in the rooms, the shower, and even flat screen TV in the rooms shows how much they pay attention to details.  The hotel also seems very conscientious of the environment with pump shower gel and shampoo.

Lastly, the gym is modest, but pretty complete.  It also wasn't very busy so I was able to do most everything of what I needed in a workout.

I will definitely look for this brand of hotel in any city that I travel to in the future.  5 stars!",5,5
"Wish i wouldve read the review before I ordered from this place. Food was delivered over an hour after it was ordered. I spoke with a guy on the phone immediately after placing my order online, leaving my phone number in case he needed to reach me, yet when I called back an hour later, he had no recollection of me calling or leaving a number and claimed my order was being sent out late because he had no contact number to reach me with his questions about my order!!!!!!!!!

Completely unprofessional. Theyre lucky I prepaid with my card.",1,1
Food is always great. They are very generous with their bacon so that basically makes them perfect. I usually get the California wrap and have never been disappointed. Price is just about right and the I love the look of the place.,5,5
Baggins is one of our favorite sandwich shops - glad to see them open on the southeast side !! We arrived on a weekday after the lunch crowd and walked right up to order. We ordered a Sundown Baggins and the Baggins Cheesesteak - first time trying the cheesesteak. In a word - FANTASTIC !! I think this is the best cheesesteak I've had in the Tucson area. My wife always loves the Sundown. Not too much seating in this location - I could see this filling up quickly during busy times. One last comment - love the cinnamon tea ! Wish they had a senior discount like many other restaurants around town.,4,5
Won't be coming back. Zinger salad was half made up of week old romaine that I had to pick out. Chicken was so dry that I had to request extra hot sauce. Husband's salad was drenched in dressing...soup like. Son's hot dog was good.,2,2
"This was a great little surprise to come upon on our Cali road trip.
Amazing Tri Tip sandwich with very tasty options to put on top, the salsa wouldn't have been my first choice, but TRY IT! You'll be delighted with the freshness! 
Wonderful potato salad and good beer options, too!
The setting is what really gives me the best impression, I felt like trolls built and ran the place!
I wish this place was closer to Wisconsin, I'd love it to be my rehearsal dinner spot!",5,5
"I got my wedding dress from David's Bridal.  When I was there they told me I'd have to get it taken in, but I wasn't sure so I called Joanna and brought it to her.  I have a corset dress so she showed me what it would look like if I just tied it tighter and it was fine which saved me a bunch of money not getting it taken it.  Also David's Bridal convinced me I needed a bra, but Joanna showed me how much better it would look with cups so now it looks great and I will be more comfortable.

If I would have gotten it altered at David's Bridal I would have spent a bunch of money to get it taken in so I'm so glad that I took my dress to Joanna.  Her prices are very good and to top it off she is a very nice person.  I will definitely be going to her again if I need alterations in the future.",5,5
"Loved the atmosphere at this nail salon! Wine, champagne, and lots of available staff! I will definitely be making this nail place my go-to.",5,5
"Mmmm po boys *Insert Homer Simpson voice and drooling noise*

This place is beyond awesome.  Try everything.  No matter what you get it will be incredibly delicious and you'll leave rtm full and happy.",5,5
So amazing!!!  Brisket and fried cabbage will live in my dreams forever.  Chicken was pretty good too.  Didn't care for the rib tips.  Cocktails were different but so good.   Friendly service and a fun environment. From the street I was leery but I was pleasantly surprised.,5,5
"My family was very hungry when we dined here, and Romano's did not disappoint us!

I had the ""Chicken Portobello"" which was a huge portion that was plated over a very ample bed of ""orzo with spinach & vegetables"".  The flavors of this dish were quite impressive, not too salty as with most chain restaurants.  Only $13.99.....well worth the price due to the unlimited fresh baked bread that was delivered piping hot to our table.

Daughter had one of those Bowtie pasta dishes with chicken....it looked a lot like the dish she orders at the Cheesecake Factory.  She devoured every drop on the plate.

Wifey ordered the salmon ""low calorie"" plate, which consisted of baked salmon and fresh vegetables.  She seemed very pleased.

They are offering a special ""extra"" where you can get your choice of Appetizer and choice of dessert for only $5.99 extra. (a $13.50 value based on the individual prices of the crab-stuffed mushrooms and the smothered chocolate cake, which we all shared).

The total bill, including the tip, was under $55.  We were completely satisfied with both the food quality and service from Tyler, our young waiter.

As chain restaurants go, you could do a LOT worse than Romano's.

Due to the competition with the nearby BUFFETs at the casinos and hotels, THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION must try harder in order to lure the Reno tourists away from the cheap buffet deals that proliferate in Nevada.  

Now, if only the local Romano's in Roseville CA had the same competition.....they would be much better.",4,5
"I like this IHOP location...it caters to my family preferences by being in close proximity to child friendly stores like Walmart & Toys'r'us. There's lots of parking, decent amount of seating for both the waiting area & the dining area. I've never found the wait to be long either. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean & kid friendly with a kids menu, colouring paper & crayons, high chairs & change tables. 
Service also feels quite neighbourly, friendly & intuitive to their patrons needs and I've never felt pressured to hurry. 
There always seems to be some kind of menu special happening too & the last time I went, it was holiday stuff, so I went for the gingerbread hot chocolate...it kinda tasted like gingerbread, but leaning more towards liquid candy cola gummy flavour. I find the meals are generously portioned too. I got an omelette; it was fairly large & it came with 3 pancakes! Honestly, it was enough for a moderate sized breakfast for 2...glad I brought a friend to share with! Something new to me is that I can pay my bill at the table now, rather than paying up at the front desk. I do appreciate their early morning hours too.",4,5
"I come here 3/7 days a week and have NEVER had a bad experience.  If they get my order wrong ( which they never do) they quickly correct it.  If they feel I have waited in the drive-thru too long, I get a free coffee.  Talk about being pro-active rather than re-active.  This is the way every business should be run.",5,5
"I loved this place. Great food and for a breakfast place the menu is really good, and you can sit outside with a nice view to the bay (we saw some dolphins from the deck too!)

We got the banana foster, the Benedict eggs, and pancakes, all really good.
Will come back as soon as possible!",5,5
"I have eaten at the AYCE sushi bar at Jazmine twice now while in town on business. The quality and freshness are amazing. Every roll is prepared in front of you. My absolute favorites were the Golden Gate, which had a wonderful lemon citrus infusion, something I have never had with sushi before this, and the Caterpillar roll, a wonderful tempura selection. The service was excellent, our sushi chef was very attentive and helpful in explaining the options to us. You can also order half rolls if you are dining alone and want to try more varieties. I will definitely make Jazmine a regular stop on my business trips.

I did not try anything off the regular Asian menu, but I am sure the quality was as good as the sushi. An excellent restaurant by all measures.",5,5
"O'Malleys is probably the worst place in this area. The bouncers were beyond rude and degrading when they decided not to accept the IDs of 8 girls all over the age of 23 and when we politely asked as to why they were condescending (to put it nicely). The bouncers also failed to intervene when one of the girls in our group was groped by a stranger in front of the establishment and strangers stepped up to help. This is a place that promotes disrespect, sexual harassment, and enjoys the company of patrons that are demeaning to fellow customers. We are from out of town and during an otherwise good, fun night, the second we got to the door at O'Malleys, we felt threatened and insecure without any explanation of why we deserved such treatment. There are better bars right across the street or around the corner who have stand-up employees that did step up to help us, who did treat us with respect, and who we respected in return. Don't waste your money here.",1,1
"I've stayed at a few ES and I wouldn't put this one on my favorite list. The best thing is the overall staff. Most were really friendly and helpful. The guy who took care of housekeeping in the bar and common areas was really great and helpful. The evening manager was really good and made you feel like he cared about any issues you had. Now...as for the room. A contest for housekeepers to finish first. Gee, what could go wrong there? That was the biggest downside. It's a VERY busy hotel and it seems to me they are greatly understaffed. Housekeeping became a constant battle of half cleaning, not changing the sheets when asked, forgotten trash and just plain rush jobs. While it wasn't filthy, you could tell the room just needed a really good cleaning. Doesn't look like the bathroom floor in our room had ever been washed, and the shower and sink had what looked like mold in areas. You don't expect that at an ES. We had an issue with something in the room that could have caused injury and the manager sent someone right away, who just looked at it and said there wasn't anything he could do. We didn't feel like repacking, changing and cleaning another room so I had to summon some brain power and come up with a simple solution. If we had really needed to use that piece of furniture it would have been an issue. That I did not like at all. I don't want to have to use my brain on vacation! The clerk didn't explain the Hilton Honors benefits when we checked in so we missed out on some stuff until the trip was almost over. Make sure you ask for the benefits for Honors members. In comparison to other properties, the Manager's Reception could definitely use some imagination and an upgrade on the food. I know they want you to use the restaurant but fried pickles ain't cuttin' it. **Note to management: Some people have parental brain freeze. Closing the reception area on Sundays somehow allows parents to think (I use that word liberally) it's okay to bring their kids to the bar. Having a 7 yr old crawl up onto the stool beside me made me and the other grown ups ""uncomfortable"" to say the least. You might want to consider opening the reception or suggesting to mom and dad the bar is not the best place for kids to play tag. Lost a lot of bar money as we adults looked elsewhere to watch football. I didn't eat at the restaurant but others who did really liked the food, except for the one night when it was pretty busy and my friend's burger was dust bowl dry. For $12 you don't want to eat saw dust. The vent in our room had an odor like chlorine. By our last day it was pretty unbearable. I certainly wasn't going to call maintenance and have to think again. At that point they would have needed to offer me the job, if I was going to have to keep fixing stuff. The business center was good and well stocked. They even have a small conference room that I'm not sure if you have to pay to use. I can't tell you how many business trips that would have been great to have for quick meetings. With few exceptions, the staff is their strong point.  I say fix the housekeeping issue and I'd raise the rating much higher, even with fried pickles.",2,2
"You wouldn't believe it by walking by, but Reginelli's offers some great tasting pizza. Their crust is just right. It's not too thin, to crispy, to thick, too chewy. It's just right. I don't know why it just seems like a mediocre place from lookin around- but it is So Good.

They have a great list of speciality pizzas like the shrimp/chicken pesto (not my fav but sounds good) and the mediterranean. But what I like is that you can create your own pizza from a huge list of toppings.

I counted 36 toppings they offer!! 36 toppings to choose from! Whatever you do, get the fresh basil on top, they shred a huge load of basil and it makes the pizza mmmm.

Oh yah, there's also pastas, appetizers (hummus, spinach/artichoke dip, garlic spread, baked brie calzone- sorry i love all of these), calzones, focaccia and pita sandwiches.  

Since I live so close by it's really convenient for takeout. And the takeout has always been fast and convenient! The inside is sparcely decorated in ""italian"" style. nothing great. But definitely a solid 4 stars for staff attitude, cleanliness, speediness, and mmm factor.",4,4
"Very quaint sushi place !! I would definitely say this is a hidden gem. The happy hour deals are pretty great, they have dollar sushi and three dollar rolls",5,5
Coffee Fudge was awesome!  Great selection and good ice cream.  Worth the stop and line on a hot afternoon!,5,5
"Review for Brunch-

I am not a big fan of brunches because I dont like sweets as entrees, and lets be real- I can fry my own egg at home!! So I was pretty excited when I saw the brunch menu which included korean fried chicken and burmese braised pork bellie with soy sauced egg. My kind of breakfast!! My friend (party of 6) also ordered the pork bellie and we were both super disappointed. The dish was drenched in sauce, making it so salty that it was impossible to eat...I mean, I ate everything, but I am abnormal and NEVER waste food. I am 100% positive that a normal person would be unable to tolerate the saltiness. My other friend ordered the pancakes and he said it was so-so. 

On the positive note, the restaurant has an amazing bloodymary selection where you can create your own bloodymary mix. So if you are in the mood to experiment what other flavors compliment tobasco sauce - go for it!",3,3
"Without a doubt, the best tomato pie I've ever had!!!! Quite frankly, I don't know why other places around here even try because there is no competition. The pies are ready for pick up, so all you have to do is come in and pay.

I've never had anything else because I can't tolerate the smell in here. It always smells like old meat and gives me a massive headache.",4,4
We avoided coming here our entire stay in Indian rocks because of the negative reviews. On our last full day here we were at the pool and splash park and realized we were hungry but not ready to go home and go elsewhere for lunch. We decided to go into Jimmy Guana's and had rather low expectations. Everything we experienced exceeded our expectations. Both the island wrap and the hog sandwich were excellent. Kids meals were good too and as an added bonus the kids got children's menus that doubles as iguana hat. Don't let the reviews scare you. It's definitely a good place for lunch.,4,5
"CONSTRUCTION!!!!  See video.

Very nice looking hotel with pretty good customer service.  Giving 3 stars due to active construction taking place outside my room starting at 5:45am (time of this review) and lack luster continental breakfast.  

My room is very comfortable but does show signs of cheap remodel.  There are obvious signs of paint work on the walls, bathroom lights need changing, worn down fixtures (switches on wall) that don't have the cool vintage look, more just 'need to be replaced' look.  Cheap tin ceiling tiles that are misaligned in the bathroom.  

Breakfast appears very fancy, and is delivered each morning, but is a just a cup of instant oatmeal, a little cup of yogurt, and a piece of fruit - stuff I would expect from a cheap motel, not a boutique hotel such as this. 

The view from my room was pretty disappointing as well - just a view of active construction of the side of the building about 3ft away.

Front desk was friendly and welcoming, but for the price I would stay somewhere that has the same charm but no construction that begins at 5:45am on a Friday morning, and a few nicer things that a ""boutique"" hotel should offer.",3,3
"I went here, I want to say, four times. A couple of times just for beers and once for lunch and once for an evening meal. Good staff, good food, reasonable prices on the beer, a good atmosphere and a less touristed part of the world.  I had the Cabo Shrimp and Grits and it was one of the first times I've really liked grits which always just seemed to be soggy grains; an excellent meal. The Pao Pao Shrimp Poboy was nice.

There's a couple of areas to it, a surfer bar out the back. That kind of thing.

If you are looking for something in the area after a visit to the WW2 museum or the oddly unpolitical civil war museum or if you are willing to walk from the convention centre then this would be a great choice.",5,5
"Good food, service was a bit curt. Kind of a weird vibe, but I'm not sure if it was good or bad, just a lot like Vegas casino restaurants.",4,3
"My first trip to Sauce on the Side was an A+ experience. Someone will say hi to you when you walk in giving you an instant feel for the friendly neighborhood atmosphere. You order at the register from a selection of about 15 different calzones and salads. The cashier was very friendly. All calzones are made fresh to order.

I ordered the Carmen. The spicy prosciutto and capicola combined with smooth ricotta and mozzarella was perfect and flavorful. The crust was the perfect combo of soft and crisp. The garlic sauce was an excellent complement, not too salty or garlicky.

I will definitely be back and intend to try a dessert calzone while I'm at it!",5,5
"I had the worst lunch here ever. The service was slow and barely there, even though the place was practically empty. When it finally did arrive, there was a huge metal spring, or some kind of wire in my pizza that I only noticed when I bit down already. The manager was pretty rude and dismissive over it, which bothered me the most. I've worked in customer service before, and you just don't act that way after possibly injuring them.",1,1
"We are snowbirds and have visited Claim Jumper each year we've been in Tucson.  After reading the ""less than positive"" reviews recently, we decided to visit Claim Jumper again this year to see if we noticed a difference from past years.  The one complaint I'd ask management to address is this:  If a patron has ordered a beer and it's necessary to change out the keg, please instruct your wait staff to alert the patron that the keg needs to be changed and ask the patron if they'd like to wait for the particular beer they ordered or if they'd like to order a different beer.  Having the patron remind the wait staff that they're waiting for their beer, and the wait staff telling the patron that the manager is pouring the beer right now, with the patron having to wait another 10 minutes for a beverage, and only learning that the keg needed to be switched when the server finally brings the beer, is NOT COOL!",3,3
"Best massage in Philly, likely the best in the Milky Way Galaxy. Having received massages on a semi-regular basis for years to help with migraine headaches and general stress, I'd never experienced more immediate and lasting results than from my one hour massage with Kate at Selcouth Massage. Kate is clearly an expert at the top of her field and her knowledge of specific bodywork techniques capable of eliciting lasting muscle relief appears quite unparalleled. Further, Selcouth boasts a beautiful and welcoming environment. If you value a thoughtful practitioner and serene experience, look no further.",5,5
"My wife and I celebrated Valentine's Day at Watermark. Neither of us had been here, and were looking forward to it.

We started with cocktails and appetizers. I had a drink which I think was called a Seelback, and my wife had a honey ginger martini. For apps, we split a salad with beets, cheese, etc and a crab and shrimp galette. Both were great, but if I had to pick one, it would be the galette. Buttery, seafood with a hint of citrus in the sauce. Nice.

My wife's entree was Grouper (paired with a glass of Chablis), substituting for Tilefish as the Tilefish was 86. She didn't mind a bit. It was a great plate of food. For my entree I had the Pheasant (paired with a Pinot Noir) with grits, sun-dried tomatoes, and kalamata olives. The pheasant was awesome. It didn't have a gamey tast at all. 

We finished the night with a couple cocktails and were proud of the restaurant choice we made.",5,5
"growing up in Philly, this was one of the places that started my love affair with Korean food.  one of my my favorite Korean restaurants in Philly.  

those who know me know that although I eat meat, tofu is my protein of choice.  tofu, broth, spicy...  ahhh delicious!  their tofu stew totally hits the spot, especially around fall and winter months.

parking lot in side/rear and there is usually ample street parking.",5,5
"I was craving Indian. My boyfriend loves Indian food and took me to a joint in Trooper. I wasn't too fond of that place and we figured we would give this one a try. The poppadoms were delicious as well as all the chutneys. The lamb samosas were amazing. We had the chicken tikka masala.
Sauce was good. I didn't like the chicken breast... wish they would have used thigh meat. Very very laid back service. I will most likely come back to try their other dishes :)",4,4
Great drink prices friendly attractive staff. Simple spot to hit for a few drinks and conversation.  Oh! And a mechanical bull,4,5
"I love it when restaurants get the simple things right! It may be exciting to have your tacos laced with Chiplotle-Hazelnut Glaze and a sprig of Organic Norwegian Lichen but it all falls apart when the tortilla sucks, or the rice is pasty.

Cuernavaca doesn't have any of that fancy crap, but the rice, beans, meat, tortillas are just done RIGHT! Everything is cooked to perfection, seasoned nicely and assembled with care. Also, it's the only Mexican restaurant I've been to that actually gives you enough tortillas for the quantity of food. What's up with getting 2 tortillas and a pound of fajitas!? That doesn't happen here!

The salsa bar has a couple rare and tasty options that aren't found in many other places (the Peanut salsa is a smokey, hearty treat and the avocado salsa is refreshing in spite of its high spiciness).

Everything I've had is delicious and there are a couple really nice vegetarian options... I have a hard time staying away from the Sabores though. The Pastor is truly a delicious treat.",5,5
Ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict with Cajun potatoes. The flavor was excellent and the presentation was nice. The portions were quite small however. I also ordered a Bloody Mary which was superb. The location and view are wonderful. The open air layout with a view of St Louis Cathedral is hard to beat.,4,4
"This place is everything you'd ever want a neighborhood coffee shop to be. The pastries are exceptional, the drinks are tasty, and the staff is incredibly kind. The prices are reasonable, too. Highly recommend this place.",5,5
"I love this place!   Today's pedi and foot massage was wonderful !!  Peter is wonderful!!  I've been several times & had different technicians and I've never had a bad experience.  They serve soda, water or wine & are all very gracious.  The pedi tubs have disposable plastic liners and the whole place is very clean.  I've had my eyebrows waxed multiple times and they're always great.  And Peter did cute flowers today on my toes and I love them!",5,5
"was glad to have gotten a good room rate due to the race taking place right outside. nice balcony room but if it had not been an overcast, cold day, the noise from the pool would have been intolerable. and not happy with a room next to the elevator but fully booked so nothing i could do. front desk clerk coming off night shift had major attitude but understandably so with the chaos of the race. the two ladies that came on after him were extremely pleasant and got me into my room almost 2 hours early. room was comfy (two chairs would have been nice though) and the bed was extremely comfortable but too noisy for a such a ""classy"" hotel. and for the price, get better toilet paper. jeez. Mary the spa lady was nice but a little pushy. Just point me to the pool/jacuzzi but instead got a tour i said i didn't want. pretty, classic decor.",4,3
"My wife and I go to Indianapolis fairly often, and when we do, we usually have at least one breakfast/brunch at First Watch since we don't have them in Chicago. I love this location since it is walking distance from the convention center. A bunch of my friends and I went to Gen Con last year and I made sure we fueled up for long days of gaming with breakfast at First Watch.",4,5
"I spent 6 weeks in Thailand this year, and I still prefer The Smiling Elephant.

"Disclaimer: I love any shop that caters to all types of diets! However, despite that, this place is really good. After finishing our meal at Grateful Gardens next door, my bf and I decided to top it off with a cupcake. They have regular, gluten free, vegan, and paleo options - so there is something for everyone. I had their GFV chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting and was throughly impressed. Would go back again the next time I visit Reno.",5,5
Oh my god never eat here! I have never received such rude service in my life. I totally understand that cinco de mayo is a crazy day for Mexican restaurants but that is no reason to treat customers like crap. There are so many places to eat in the city that you won't get treated horribly. Just go to Juans or arana.,1,1
"My new favorite cocktail bar in Indianapolis. I love the personal service that you get at the Libertine and I can't wait to go back and try more cocktails. The Screw and Bolt is AMAZING. I have never been a huge fan of Gin, but the small little touches and the way they have perfected their cocktails...it just can't be missed.",5,5
"Best ice cream probably on the planet.  Beats the Penn State Creamery.  The changing flavors makes it tough to pick a favorite, but it has to be chocolate peanut butter.  Bananas for Elvis a close second!  Lines are usually to the door, but it's worth it.  cash only so don't get mad if you don't have any on you. You can always eat that horrid Fro-yo.....",5,5
"Hands down the best service I've ever received in a club the cocktail servers, dancers, and security were all great we spent two nights in VIP for my bachelor party weekend and will be back very soon hands down best club in Reno. If your going the VIP route request Sara!",5,5
"Living in Santa Barbara, there are a bunch of great authentic Mexican restaurants to choose from - there's no disputing that.  However, if you're in the mood for something relatively quick, healthy and filling - Wahoos is always a great option.  Like most every Wahoos I've been to, the people are super friendly and the enchiladas will rock your socks off.  Salud!",4,5
"I have found myself stopping in here mostly for the awesome food and great location along the cultural trail. This place is definitely catered toward the soccer crowd as far as the decorating goes, but is inviting for anybody looking for a place to sit down and get a beer and some food. There is a bar with seating, as well as plenty of tables inside.  If it's a nice day out, the large multilevel patio outside is fantastic and provides a quite place to eat or drink since it is located behind the restaurant and not on Mass Ave. 

The food consists mostly of sandwiches and burgers, but they are unlike many you will find at other places and offer many interesting toppings and combinations. I highly recommend getting the portabella mushroom fries as an appetizer, which I tried for the first time and will now be making trips there just for those. A couple at one of the tables ordered one of the pizzas that they offer and it looked amazing as well. I'd say the food here is some of the best in Indy as far as pub style food goes, and almost everything comes in at under $10. The beer menu is also great and offers a dozen or so beers on tap with a good mix of the usual craft beers with some great Sun King selections as well, and a pretty extensive bottle menu is also available if nothing on tap sounds good.

My big complaint is that the service was actually pretty slow for the small crowd that was there. I'd say the staff on hand when I was there last was almost equal to 1 server for every 2 customers, but we had to flag down our server to get refills and to place our order after sitting for a long time with our menus. The person who got us drinks is who we flagged down to place a food order but she went and got somebody else to take that for us, so maybe it was just a mix-up that left us without a server this time, but it has seemed slow for all of the few times that I have visited. I haven't been there for a late night visit when it sounds like it is the busiest, but I hope that the service picks up for that crowd compared to what it was like for the dinner customers. The food will keep me coming back, but it does seem that the service needs to be stepped up a few notches.",3,4
Fantastic find! Wonderful service and the best bread! Can't wait to go back! They are only open for Breakfast & lunch but you can tell that its the place to be. We will have to go back and have both breakfast & lunch because the hamburger with egg on it was definitely worth going back!,5,5
"The food was good but the attitude of the waiter and cashier made for a really horrible dining experience. First off, I am not sure if the waiter was having a bad day but he made a bunch of smart ass comments the whole meal. Service sucked! Had to ask twice for sweet and low and the second time, he said he might get it. We had to get soy sauce our self. The water glasses were not filled in a timely fashion. He made a smart ass comment about using forks instead of chop sticks. Then to top it off, the cashier had an attitude as well. He has one job, take money. we asked him to split the check and you would have thought we spit in his face. He made a couple of comments and then I got mad and said some things back to him. Here is the deal, if customer service is your job and that is how you get paid, major fail on this visit. There will not be another visit from me. Bottom Line, we were treated like crap from beginning to end!",1,1
"I don't know man, the more I come to this place the more I am let down. I do recall having a great bloody mary here once. I like the chili and most of the food is pretty good I guess, especially for a bar. It's a totally novelty spot, the Hooters alternative, so if you want to see a father's worst nightmare and get your perv on this spot is calling your name. I recently learned that they do trivia on Wednesdays and beer pong on Thursdays, so there's that. Party on Wayne.",3,3
Delicious fresh organic food bar that I probably can never tire of. Use to come here a lot when I was closer by. Great selection. Parking lot.,5,5
"Rude lazy welfare mongrels. I didn't make you get this job. Uh, don't chips come with? Why did you act like I was asking for something that I'm not allowed to have?  The guacamole was brown. Just the bad attitude made my meal unenjoyable. I didn't make you get this job. At least if you're going to do a job, do it to your best ability with dignity and honor.",1,1
"The BEST sandwiches I've ever tasted.

In from Chicago for a week...once we had lunch here we came back every remaining day.  The only bad thing I have to say is we didn't discover the place until the second to last day.  Will come back this summer and singlehandedly pay their rent.

Tried a couple of their sandwiches du jour.  Aporkalypse was one.  Sandwiches are perfectly moist and even though very large, I dare you to not shovel every last morsel and eat the paper they served it on!

Always a line down the sidewalk that is worth the wait.  Service speedy, great variety of unique chips and sides.  

Note to Management: Please move 300 miles north....please!",5,5
"The food here is consistently amazing. It's great English Pub food presented the way it should, perfectly cooked and simply presented. Really great draft and bottle selection also, highly recommend!",5,5
"Customer services is so important these day if you want to stand out in the crowed of many other bars, cafes or restaurants. That is something the staff here did very well. The food I had was OK, it was just a grill cheese but the staff will make me return, thanks guys.",4,4
"This place was great !  Super good food and drinks.  The fish and chips was perfect.  They also have these cool swinging egg chairs that kept the kids occupied while waiting for dinner.  Very nice place.  Upscale bar and restaurant,  great date place but also family friendly too.",5,5
Won best cheesesteak in NJ by Courier Times. Steak was good but cook went nuts with salt shaker-almost to the point I didn't want to eat the sandwhich. They did a nice job mixing the cheese in with the steak and toasted the roll. The cup of chicken noodle soup was fantastic - homemade goodness. Also loved the pickles they bring out. Iced tea was homemade and tasty. Came with fries and a delicious cole slaw. Thought $19 was a little high priced but this place does a good job. The excessive salt kept me from going 5 stars. If this is the best South Jersey has to offer Johns Roast Pork and Steve's Prince of Steaks have no challengers across the bridge.,3,4
I have had lunch at the Kabob house many times. The food has been consistent and very good. Love the rice even though I am not a rice fan. Priced very reasonable. Definitely recommend trying it!,5,5
"I needed a manicure since my hands had gotten so dry and nails so brittle while traveling during winter. Kim took great care to shape my nails the way I like them and used 5 different drill bits to get a nice shape. Thank you, Kim! I'll be back next time in Tampa!",5,5
"4 stars for the food, 1 for the service (or lack thereof) which is a major bummer since I've been stalking them on instagram for a while and had been anxious to try it out. So we had a reservation but while we waited for 15 minutes or so, another couple came in and was offered seats at the counter.  Not sure why we weren't?      We were seated shortly thereafter at one of the darkest tables in an already too dark restaurant and for some odd reason our waitress came and took both of our candles away. :( So about her, Kathleen, our waitress...she dropped a portion of our dinner at the table and ran away/disappeared thereafter with no explanation regarding the missing food. A waiter, who must have taken pity on us finally brought over our lukewarm chorizo mac and then eventually our duck fat fries. Kathleen made many subsequent  trips past our table while we ate but never said jacksh#t to us. No hey, how is everything,  can I get you more water, go f*ck yourself, nothing. I wasn't mad though until I heard her offer all of her other tables dessert and/or coffee before then offering the check but then in contrast saying to us ""are we done here?"" when she finally made an appearance to take our plates. I'm not sure I've ever been to a restaurant where that happened in my life. Thanks Kathleen. Anyway the fries were as good as everyone says. The general tso's wings were delicious but soooooo sticky. General's tacos were good as well but a bit overstuffed. The chorizo mac was just ok. I thought it would have been better if it were more like a traditional mac with crispy chorizo and maybe a hint of cumin but the seasoning was way too heavy and it wasn't nearly cheesy enough. Now, the decor and ambience in this place was just downright weird. Aside from being too dark, whoever designed it must have quit halfway through because the country kitchen, semi-industrial look was unappealing to say the least. Concrete floors, modern loft style lighting, and an open kitchen complimented by horrible cottage-esque wainscoting, wooden roosters, farm chairs and grandma plates all over the wall was as weird to me as it sounds.  And the music...oh my god. Hilarious. I heard Ja Rule, Eminem, Ludacris, 50 Cent and Tyrese to name a few. You had to see the crowd to understand the comedy there I suppose but either way as loud as it is in there already they probably could have 86'd it altogether. Otherwise something a little more suited to the crowd and the No Libs-esque menu and I am assuming intended vibe of the place. Definitely won't be going back anytime soon.",3,2
Wow! Let me just say this place is phenomenal! My husband is Puerto Rican and I have had some Spanish food and this did not disappoint. The less than wonderful service is EASILY overlooked due to the amazing food! Never had better tostones in my life! So glad we stumbled upon this place!,5,5
"I was hoping for an authentic experience at this hole in the wall taqueria, but found everything mediocre at best.  The carnitas taco was void of most meat, having a scant cover of maybe an ounce with just a tiny garnish of cilantro and onion.  The al pastor had more meat, but was nothing like al pastor I've come to enjoy throughout both Mexico and many authentic taquerias state side.  The sope (choizo) seemed deep fried and generally not a good quality.  The final and most disappointing was the mix pupusa- it was devoid of all filling save a few beans and pieces of meat the size of peas.  I even deconstructed it to see what was in there, and it was just a sad doughy mess.  No salsas for anything, and the obligatory slaw for the pupusa had no tangy or spicy that even a decent Mexican or Central American restaurant should have.  Maybe I ordered the worst four items on the menu, or they were having an off day, but I won't be finishing my meal, yet alone go back.  The search for dinner continues.",2,1
"A couple months ago my fiance and I decided to have our wedding here for next year. We sat down with the owner ""Maria"" and decided on everything we were going to do. The next day, I tried to get her the deposit, but we could not get in touch with her at all. We emailed, called, nothing. Now we are searching for a new location because of Maria's poor business offerings. 

She was very unprofessional and very discourteous for not responding to ANY OF OUR ATTEMPTS TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER. To anybody else attempting to have your wedding here, BEWARE, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!! LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!",1,1
"So room smells of smoke , had to pay $20 resort fee(really like overpriced room was not enough) and put next to busy road- avoid this place",1,1
"I always walked past this place without going in because it looks like a dive from the outside, but one fine summer morning my boyfriend finally convinced me we should give it a try. It was a Saturday morning and the place was about 3/4 full, which surprised me... and then it didn't.  Half the crowd was of the mature variety and the other half was of the probably-hungover variety. The decor inside invoked fond memories of an old local family restaurant in my hometown and I appreciated the touch of nostalgia it added.  The food is certainly not for the calorie conscious, as it is your good-old-fashioned home-style cookin' with plenty of carbs and a decent dollop of grease.  The breakfast portions are huge, so show up hungry and ready to hit the gym afterwards! This is a great place to go when you're craving a classic farmer breakfast, and for me it's a super convenient walk from where I live, so that's a huge bonus. I appreciate the uniqueness of the ketchup, but I do find it a bit odd.  A bit too spicy - I like my traditional Heinz ketchup when I'm eating a massive plate of hash browns, eggs and bacon - but that's just me.  I also found the hash browns a bit too spicy as well, which was odd but not off-putting.  The seasoning certainly puts a unique twist on a classic breakfast. Anyone who is curious about Tasty Tom's should definitely try it at least once!",4,4
I'm pretty sure this is actually Gloucester Township Park and Gloucester Twp is in Camden County.,3,3
"This location and layout is fantastic!  It made my little weekend vacation so nice!

I'm a light beer lady, so I didn't feel like I had a ton of tap choices (at least enough to have a flight that day), but love the atmosphere here.  The service is great and my hubby loved the stout and sour selections.

Recommended to us by a good friend- it was excellent.",4,5
"So... this was my second time there.

I LOVE my hair CUT. I asked for layers and they look amazing... however... I decided to get color too & deeply regret it. I wanted a low-light that looked natural... I provided a picture and all.

What I ended up with were huge brown stripes, I look like a brown and black zebra. Very disheartening because I trusted my stylist was going to be honest about his coloring experience.",2,2
"I went last night to give it a whirl. Was very good. Ordered whiting, mac, yams, & a side of greens. Ive had better greens but they were still good & tasty. My hunni had wings which was also good & crunchy.  They were big wings too which i lovee. & that buttered roll is sooo good. They put a garlicy butter on top which tops it off. The girl taking orders could keep her complaining to herself tho telling her friend she wana go home like thats not professional 

I would recommend to try it.. next time i plan on trying the turkey chops",4,4
"Awesome job and friendly folks!

We felt we were treated fairly and received appropriate value for what we paid!!",5,5
"Great food and service found at this downtown Tucson gem of a restaurant! Great atmosphere, decor and vibe found there! Look out for the chips and two types of salsa, they are killer and you can definitely overdo it with them! LOL! I had that Ahi Tuna tostada, which they actually cooked medium for me and it was excellent! The roasted brussels sprouts are off the hook! So much flavor and topped with green onions- Yum! My husband loved his steak and the sides of rice and beans were just perfect, some of the best we've had! The mesquite style cooking that they do there is just awesome. We are so looking forward to our next visit at Charro! Definitely try this one out!",4,5
"Love this place.  I eat here almost every week.  The chicken sandwich is perfect, burgers are amazing and let's not forget about the beer.  Last year they had a street corn side that was too good, can't wait til they bring it back.  Personally I am not an IPA guy, but I enjoy most of the IPA's they brew here.  Their saison's are some of the best I've had.",5,5
"These guys are awesome! I'm not from Reno, and was only in town for one night with a friend who's birthday it happened to be. I took a leap of faith and ordered cupcakes to be delivered from Batch. Not only were they perfectly on time, but the cupcakes were awesome!! Thanks for helping to make my friend's surprise birthday celebration a success!",5,5
Had the Have a Heart and Yale's Thai pizzas and chicken wings. I would pass.,1,2
Super cool space and art. $60 for a one year membership and that's a steel. It would be worth that just to see the Holiday train display Jingle Rails. They have an upcoming exhibit on dogs. Guess who can't wait to see that.,5,5
My daughter and I stopped in today fore pedicures and shellac manicures and it was amazing.  Best pedicure I've ever had and the customer service was really great.  Since we are only here for the weekend and it was closest to our hotel it was very convenient.,5,5
"I am seriously disappointed with today's haircut.  I really wanted to like the shop because of the flexibility of walk and location . The only thing that it has going for it is location.  Not professional.  The young lady, who was the one who washes hair, was getting her hair ""blown out"" by the one of the hairdressers and both were upset that I had interrupted their time and stated so. The girl, with parts of her hair sectioned off in clips, never tested the water and burnt my scalp and then when I said ouch that's hot she froze my head with cold.  Not fun.

The haircut I received was the worst haircut I ever received.  The woman (I don't know her name because she never introduced herself or asked my name) started cutting with the razors and I pulled away.  I said can we talk about what I won't done first?  She kind of snapped out of it and said ok and then did what she wanted anyway.  I came back to work after and a co-work pointed out the uneven parts of where she chopped.  I need to go after work and pay again to have this fixed.",1,1
"Love this place! Love their cappuccinos, love the glasses they put them in, and love the outdoor seating. Sometimes the girl behind the counter is too busy using the adjective ""delicious"" to hear that I want a real cup, but other than that, great place to hang out. They always have local magazines/newspapers that have great food tips for everyone to take/read.",5,4
"I get lunch here between classes about once a week. The value can't be beat, the service is quick and friendly, and the verde sauce is hella good. Love love love this cart.",5,5
"Food is OK although feel a little over-priced.  The Etoufee and smoked pork shank are good, although nothing really super to justify the price.  The desserts are good although nothing really strikes me.  I like the restaurant but at similar price I can get MUCH better food in my home town (SF Bay Area).
Maybe I am just spoiled...",3,3
"This place smells like smoke....the good kind. For those who love barbecue/smoked meats, the smell of this place does not disappoint, but I digress. The real question is does it taste as good (or better) than it smells? And here, having lived in the deep south for many years, is where I get a bit conflicted. I had the pulled pork...roll delicious...the meat...decent flavor, not overpowering smoke flavor (a good thing), but all in all the meat was a bit dry on it's own. The sauces offered are good, and I like that there are a few varieties on the table. However, the ""Carolina"" sauce (forget the exact name), while good is more of a sweet honey mustard with not much/none of the vinegar acidity for which Carolina barbecue (North, anyway) is known, and I was kinda expecting given the name (OK, I know, too picky). OK on to the sides....the 3yr old loved the mac and cheese. I did not get to taste any of it, but if it gets her approval, I assume its good. Fried pickles - good, but expecting more of a batter vs the breading coating from previous fired pickles I've had. Cornbread - sweet, light, delicious and a good sized portion...yummy! 
Again, I freely admit the minor knocks on the things above are based on my comparing against what is likely an unreal expectation (real southern barbecue in the north...), but all in all it's good and I'd go back to try other things on the menu. Forgot to mention they do have a pretty extensive menu and a lot of sides to choose from, so there is a lot to try here. Oh, service..nice, helpful, and friendly....",3,4
"Would definitely go back- we ordered the following
1. Blue Duck Fries: 8 out of 10
2. Duck mac n cheese: 5 out of 10 (maybe try a more flavorful cheese! not a ton of flavor on this!)
3. Beast of the east burger: 10 out of 10 (tomato jam is stupid delicious and the combo of boar and beef is just ridiculously good. The brioche bun is great not too greasy. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had)
4. Fried chicken: 10 out of 10- the cheesy collard greens were amazing! The chicken was crispy without being overly greasy, perfect amount of savory saltiness with a little kick. Best fried chicken 

Restaurant is a bit small and very loud- they have music playing somewhat loud- could do without the music since its so small and can get so loud- this is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.A cute vibe, with a great theme- duck in many apps and entrees. Love this place!",4,4
"Concept, decor, and bathrooms great. Waitress, blah. Food, blah. But a great looking place and vibe. Get happier staff and a real chef. Or just stick to beer.",2,3
"I'd been hearing about The Depot from friends, so when I had the opportunity to catch lunch here last week, I jumped on it. The food was very good. It has the typical hipster fare (slides, confit, poutine, creative tacos), but the flavors really deliver. My only gripe was the service. Yes, they were busy, but I don't think we ever got a refill on drinks, and we were more or less ignored after our food arrived. The staff was pleasant enough, and we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal.",4,4
"This felt like I stepped back in time :) the gentlemen were dressed in ties and sporting grey hair and were just as in love with their craft as if they were 20-something again. 

I didn't quite know what to expect and was SO pleasantly surprised! They play about a 45 minute set and take requests from the audience- it's tiny, old school, so about 60-75 people fit in the space. And I LOVE it when they sing with some of their tunes. Will Smith was on trumpet and Ricky Monie was on piano when we were there and were completed with a clarinet player (TWO due to a special guest), drums, bass, and trombone. 

Truly a unique experience and so worth $15.",5,5
I took my brother and his fiancé for dinner tonight. It was our first time dining and we had an ABSOLUTE BLAST! Johnathan was our server and he was knowledgeable and super personable! The food was superb! We each got something different and loved our meals (especially the brick chicken). We also got the duck spring rolls which were super tasty!! I would absolutely recommend other people to dine here and would definitely tell them to request Johnathan!  We will definitely be back!!,5,5
"Possibly the worst fish (fish?) tacos I've ever been served. Grouper was cold, stringy and a bit slimey. The server was very friendly, offered to bring another plate that was more ""well done."" She confided that she asked the cook herself if the fish was thoroughly cooked before she served it. Ugh, the second set of tacos were just as awful, still cold and stringy. What?? I couldn't even drown the taste with salsa. It tasted like the stuff that comes in the gallon containers in a fast food joint. The restaurant could use some updating as well, seems shabby and the bathrooms questionable. In all fairness, the manager came to the table and apologized and took the meal off the check. Overall a disappointing luncheon experience.",1,1
"Transformational. I have been all over the world including two weeks in Japan a few months past. This is world class. One of the more memorable meals of my life. Served perfectly with unusual senses engaged. Unique tastes, perfect portions, Five course price fixe. Absolutely a perfect evening. Limited seatings, no drop ins. Really made for a special anniversary. It is really mind blowing. Service perfect. Sake lovely. ONLY small improvement could be art on the wall which is lacking. If you love fish, sushi, shashimi, and a unique experience---The best in Santa Barbara, Southern California, California and well beyond.",5,5
First had Lotaburger in New Mexico and am happy there is one close to me here. As other reviews have noted the help can be less than enthusiastic (but I think that has improved). The food however is very good. I love their green chile cheeseburger and fries.,4,4
"I was at an appointment nearby and was having a little hankering for a Mexican Burrito. I wanted one that was homemade, not at a chain where the beans are rehydrated and dry. WELL, I will tell you this place hit the spot. It may be simple and to the point but the beans or creamy and thick and the tortilla - - I am pretty sure - - was homemade as it had the most fresh and sweet odor I have smelled in a while. It only came adorned with cheese, but the pico de gallo and the red salsa made up the difference for me. Next time I'm craving a good taco or a burrito, I'm going to pass by all the little chains that have popped up locally, as well as  the big national guys and head down to this mom and pop stop. It is so worth the fresh flavors! Give it a shot. I just wish they had a little more to offer... Like fresh soft corn tortillas as well. Then maybe my stars will pop up to a five star. Maybe after reading my review it might appear on the menu :-).??. I sure hope so.",4,4
"Fast diner food and diner service. Best hot chocolate around. No complaints.  Their desserts look really good, but I haven't tried any.  I also think I've only been there for breakfast.",4,4
"I LOVE vintage. Damn near LIVE for vintage, actually. I have a deep and abiding love of all things vintage and revere pretty much anything old...but you couldn't pay me to go back to this place! There are far too many other great vintage shops in St. Louis that offer just as good or better quality and pricing, without the godawful crappy attitude. This was hands-down the worst experience I have ever had in a vintage store. The owner and her seamstress/ shop worker were equally rude to everyone who entered the store. I was there for about 2 hours, thoroughly looking over all the stock for sale and then also had to wait for a dressing room for awhile. 
When I advised the owner that one of the dresses had a hole and the zipper was stuck, she seemed affronted I would mention it: ""Well for a $32 dress, I'm not fixing it.""  I just thought she might want to know since she had a seamstress working there. Then, I picked up a pair of dress clips that had a price tag on one of the pair. When I went to pay, she said that it wasn't one price for both. This is like pricing earrings individually. And who has ever heard of someone going UP on the price at checkout? 
When a woman trying 60s dresses on asked if they had another dress in the same style, the owner sneered: ""You've seen everything!"" I exchanged a roll of the eyes with said tryer-on's friend. She treated everyone like a suspect and just oozed a negativity that I would defy the happy-go-luckiest of people to rise above. It's really too bad because there were a few decent pieces to be had and I was initially impressed that all items were marked with measurements, even if prices were on the high end. Pay more and get this sh*tty attitude? Uh, no thanks! 
I feel really sorry for this woman that she is so miserable. And I feel sorrier for the few lovely treasures that call this place home--they and YOU deserve much better!",1,1
"I've been twice,  first time it was pretty good we had the crab cake, greens and potatoes. Second time was very upset we tried the poboys the pork and the Red fish one, very salty and not a real poboy sandwich  barely any fish on there and pickles onions and sauce that's it!!! if you've ever had one before theirs will disappoint you. Bread was hard and the chips they gave were like crumbs and very salty everything this time just taste like a bunch of salt was used to season all their food. The greens were not like what I had the first time at all different type of greens and peppers in them. So to be honest it seemed like they were short on food and just threw something together this go round, not consistent at all!!! And also for what you get it's overpriced,,, they are making a killing over nothing",1,1
His place has the best Tacos in Tucson/Marana. Everyone should try the chicken hard tacos,4,5
Good food for a good price. The staff was nice and the place was clean; what more could you ask for? Maybe a few more tables which makes this place great for takeout. I'd recommend the red chile burrito.,4,4
"Our waitress was great, helpful, always smiled, and always checked on us.  The restaurant is nice, and has a nice dog friendly patio.  But, I am sorry to say that I am a pizza snob. I'm from chicago, and I love pizza - deep dish, pan, thin crust. I love it with tons of sauce and flavor in the crust.  It's fine for me to ask for more sauce on the side. I just feel like the crust was nothing special to me. 

It's hard for me to find that in FL. I have found a couple places, but I can not say that this is the place.",2,3
"Excellent filet and mashed potatoes! Steak was cooked perfectly, potatoes were creamy and flavorful. Our waiter was very attentive, we never had to look for him. The restaurant had a nice ambiance. Would definitely return next time we visit the city.",5,5
"Two words..banana pudding! I'm a huge banana pudding fan and I was so excited to try another bakers take on this classic recipe. Absolutely delicious. I ended up with the salted caramel BP and didn't want it to end. The staff were super friendly, letting me try all flavors and welcoming us to the area. If I'm in Philly again I'll be stopping here!",5,5
"My first time to eat Beck food and it was totally cajun. I had ordered the gumbo, jambalaya bowl and shrimp and crawfish pasta. The jambalaya is really spicy and had to counter it with the pasta. It was so good I just had to bring some home to NYC.",5,5
I absolutely love thrift shopping. I visited The Green Shag Market over my Christmas Break with my sister and we loved it. This is not a thrift shop that over prices their items. They have unique items including baseball paraphernalia and old records at reasonable prices. I picked up a knock-of Louis Vuitton clutch and get a ton of compliments on it!,5,5
"Soooo good.   

If you've never been here before, order a few of their small plates and then just keep reordering after you've tried some.  Food came out very quick, maybe 5 minutes.  

Great atmosphere and everything we ordered was great. You only need to avoid the duck. I had 2 separate diners comment to me that everything was wonderful except the duck which was just ok.

Our server David was excellent.  Just the right level of attentiveness and very friendly.

Definitely a place that I recommend and I hope to return soon.",5,5
"I hope this place lasts longer than its previous tennets. 

Staff is very friendly and the prices are decent for what it is. 

The whisky selection is awesome. They have flights and are quick to recommend something if you're a little lost.

Went there on a Saturday night and it wasn't packed. Wasn't empty either. Its a very classy place. Very warm. Not divey, but not super upscale either.",4,4
Cute little shop with quality merch from brands women will likely recognize. That plus the always pleasant staff always makes for a positive shopping experience. This is definitely one of my favorite places to pop into when I'm in downtown Haddonfield.,4,5
"Great location with super friendly staff & nice food however in my opinion, the price just isn't reflective of a Greek BYOB. Two (small) starters, two (small) mains & one bottle of water came to $110 (inc 20% tip). Don't get me wrong, the food was good but $110 good? I don't think so.. I've heard the Sunday tasting menu is great value so will certainly go back to try this.",3,3
Still the best pralines and tortues ever. And I also got a peanut butter chocolate covered oreo for 50 cents. Soooo good.,5,5
"Im French Quarter von New Orleans (NO) vibriert die Luft. Von überall schweben Melodien durch die Luft, aus Häusern, Bars oder von der open-street Szene. Jazz ist die dominate Musik. Und Jazz at its best  das hat Doreen, unschlagbar, einmalig, ein Genuss an der Ecke Royal/St. Peter  ihr Straßendomizil. Gemeinsam mit ihren Mitmusikern zelebriert sie den Jazz in einer ehrlichen Form, wie er authentischer nicht sein kann. (Siehe Foto unten) Doreen ist eine Meisterin an der Klarinette, unglaublich wie sie einen einzigen Ton unendlich lange halten kann, die Luft scheint ihr nie auszugehen. Begeisternd wenn ihre Finger über die Tasten der Klarinette wirbeln, einen mitreißen, so dass man seinen eigenen Körper nicht mehr still halten kann und in der Musik auf- und mitgeht. Wenn dann aus der Tiefe ihres Körpers der Gesang ertönt, ist es um die Zuhörer geschehen. Selbst Ohrwürmern des Jazz, die oft ihre Spritzigkeit verloren haben, da sie zu häufig und immer wieder gespielt werden, verleiht Doreen neues Leben, rauchig, Stakkato, brüchig  lebendig. Doreen hat viele Labels veröffentlicht, auch wir kauften berauscht von ihrer Musik eine CD und haben es bereut, nicht gleich mehrfach zugeschlagen zu haben. In der Jazzszene ist Doreen ein bekannter Name. In den USA tritt sie regelmäßig in allen großen Radio- und Fernsehsendern auf, außerdem tourt sie immer wieder  aber ihre Wurzel und Heimat ist NO an der Ecke Royal/St. Peter. Ich zitiere aus dem Beiheft der gekauften CD: We are Doreen's Jazz New Orleans, The Show Stealers. Our show stopping performances at private engagements and music festivals all over North & South America, Canada, Europe, Asia and Russia have given us this name. We are experienced at putting on shows that make the audience go crazy with excitement. We not only entertainer audiences but also educate thru music, the rich, historic and diverse culture of New Orleans . We have performed in many places around the world for Dignitaries and Royalty which are great acomplishments. However, lately thru Jazz At Lincoln Center and The US Dept. of State, we have had the privilege of teaching the traditions of New Orleans Jazz to children and adults alike, in schools and universities from Asia to Africa. Dem ist nichts hinzuzufügen! Fazit: New Orleans ist eine berauschende Stadt, die dem Besucher ein Füllhorn an Attraktionen bietet. Ich empfehle, genügend Zeit einzuplanen, um bei Doreen (so denn sie nicht gerade auf Tour ist) sich dem Genuss der Jazzmusik hinzugeben. Mit leichter Hand vergebe ich fünf Sterne. Tipp: Auf youtube gibt es diverse Aufnahmen von Doreen!",5,5
"Great BYOB and open late. Perfect for large groups. 

Surrounded by chinatown cuisine which can become monotonous, Panang breaks the mold.

Malaysian cuisine is an interesting combination of Chinese and Indian food. My friend who is a vegetarian loves it and is a regular. 

The staff is very friendly and the service is prompt!

Can't go wrong on a weeknight.",4,5
Great stuff. Beef n cheese plus gravy fries was recommended and devoured. Be here on the regular when I visit my Philly clients.,4,5
"amazing coffee and sandwiches ready for you at any time.


only complaint... not a super wawa",4,4
Tasty pralines! Even rounded down my bill so I didn't have to break a bill. Highly recommended.,5,5
"Jack Patrick's is easily my favorite lunch spot (happy hour too).  The food is awesome - always order the special of the day! The cook specializes in Mexican & Italian fare. Enjoyed a delicious stuffed, authentic pork burrito today (huge & filling), side of chips & queso ($8.75). The soup of the day, always homemade, is always a good choice to order. The staff is friendly, fun, makes you wanna stick around.  Good , cheap eats - highly recommended!",5,5
"I hate when I call the Auto Center and they don't answer your call that it goes straight to FAX.  Do they wish I never called to begin with.  That probably an omen not to call back.  I sure the customers in the waiting room and check out line are suffering worse.  I just called the Automotive dealer down Clearview on the other side of overpass and they greeted me kindly forwarded me to a rep, who took my information down, and called me back in 15 minutes with availability, a price for tires, and a price for service.",1,1
"It was alright.

I just stepped in because i had heard from a couple other people that i should try it out, personally i think Company Burger is better, and there's that other spot up on Oak st. i can't remember at this moment, but yeah, those two places are smashing Smashburger.",3,3
"I remember when this farmer's market started. I was new to the neighborhood, they were new to the neighborhood, it was love at first sight, yaddayaddyadda...I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE STRAWBERRIES.

We've both evolved. I moved to the West Coast and did some soul-searching, and this farmer's market tripled while I was away!

It's still great, though. They offer free yoga in the early morning. They have that awesome fountain going off for the kiddos. You can shop for top-notch produce AND grab some iced coffee and a fresh crepe (or pastry or yummy bread from any one of many bakeries present...I also saw some 25-cent lemonade!). There's a mushroom booth with some of the most mouth-watering mushrooms I've ever set eyes on (I walked away with Truffle Mushroom Butter....oh, so good....). A lot of the booths carry similar items, but they all offer something unique, as well. 

Last time I went, I walked away with a container of organic peaches, another of fingerling potatoes that I simply couldn't turn down, and a bag of heirloom tomatoes. One of the older farmers that I purchased the peaches from snuck a fresh plum into my hand and shooed me away before his wife noticed. It made me chuckle, but that was a damn fine plum. (Maybe next week I'll buy some plums from him!) Another booth insisted on giving me complimentary ice, as all of the ice in my coffee had melted. 

This is truly a neighborhood thing. Be prepared for the strong armies of strollers and some slightly inflated pricing, in comparison to Soulard and all-a that. BUT, the produce (and I assume the meats - I don't know in regards to that) is worth it. It's quality stuff and better than the majority of the option at local grocers. 

It's also a really cutesy date for a couple that's been together awhile - you know, a couple that would spend Saturday morning together, anyhow. Take a walk to the park and grab some yummy breakfast, then buy the ingredients for a kick-ass dinner. It's worth the extra few bucks. Trust.",4,5
"Ok. So, from a price point only, I have categorized this hotel as pricey to high-end because of the exchange rate from U.S. funds to Canadian...since I am Canadian. Otherwise, I would define this hotel as moderately priced.
I am a very experienced traveller, and came to Nola for the first time for a long-over due holiday. I am a solo traveller, woman in her 40's, and based upon reviews decided it would be OK to come here alone.
It is definitely a very beautiful building/hotel, if you are like me, and appreciate historical and architectural structures.. It is also in a very good location, walking distance to virtually everywhere, very quiet, and away from the bourbon street mania;) Also, a very close walk to the wonderful restaurant, Irene's! 
For the most part, the staff, specifically, the housekeeping and security personnel were definitely professional and helpful, although to be perfectly honest, I found the front desk personnel to be somewhat off-putting and quite prickly. When I checked in late at night the first night I arrived, the front desk person was messing around with my name, a really easy-to-pronounce name-not cool, and completely unnecessary. Not really a good way to start a vacation!
The restaurant, Angelines, next door to the hotel has very good food but again, some  off-putting staff, and will not be returning to this restaurant! There is also a quaint little French Brasserie around the corner from Chartres, on Ursalline's Ave that certainly has the French Quarter atmosphere, but again, off-putting cashier, and I will not be returning to this place. There are other places in the french quarter and beyond where I can  enjoy a breakfast
 cafe au lait and croissant...

So, in conclusion, I will definitely be returning to the French Quarter, but not to this Hotel, or the above-noted restaurants (with the exception of Irene's).",2,3
"I am never disappointed!  The food was great, our waitress, Diane, was a pro.  I had the steak Del Monico.  My husband had the flounder papio. Delicious!",5,5
"I'm sitting in the airport thinking about how one the biggest things I'm going to miss about New Orleans is J's Seafood and particularly their New Orleans Style Barbecue Shrimp. It is shrimp marinated in this garlic/spiced/butter sauce with a piece of French Bread to soak up the sauce with. 

When I first tried it I was wondering to myself if this was best thing I might have ever eaten in my life. 

I think I came at least 7 or 8 times after. Within that time I had to know if there was better. So I went to a few other places around town to try to see. Most of the places I went to were $5 or so above J's $10 dish and they were not nearly as good at all. A particular instance that comes to mind is a place called Mr. B's, I think it's probably one of the most high end/gourmet restaurants in NOLA. It costed like $30 for the shrimp, but I had to see. It was disappointing to say the least, it was better than all of the other places I tried, but it for sure wasn't better than J's.

Also their parmesan oysters and boiled shrimp were very good too. 

I'm gonna miss you J's Seafood.",5,5
"About as good as Italian food gets. Been going here for years, quality of food and service are as good as ever (just went again 2 weeks ago). I'd put their Veal Saltimbocca up against any other Italian restaurant in the country. Seriously, it's that good. Tight seating but still somehow intimate. New option for valet parking is huge, used this the last few times I went.",5,5
"I've tried a few items on the menu, including the windsor burger and chicken wings. Both items were good and I enjoyed the food at the time, but I never really yearned to go back to eat there.

For me, Pub & Kitchen is the kind of place where you can go to escape the cold in the middle of the winter or sit outside and have a drink at one of their sidewalk tables in the summer. I can't believe how warm and cozy the wood interior when it's cold but yet they make it so cool and airy when it's hot out.

There's a big enough bar area so you can stand or sit. There's plenty of beer, but they also have about 5 or 6 simple cocktails. Sometimes you just don't want a beer, you know? You can bring friends, family, co-workers, dates, anyone for that matter, here for a drink and they all will have a good time. If you want to get a little dressy and drink fun champagne and St. Germain cocktails, wonderful. But if you want to wear a pair of jeans and have a beer, that's ok too.

Pub and Kitchen defines the local pub, but with certain touches that really place the service and quality of the food and drinks above the rest. 

Prices are reasonable and consistent with the other area pubs.",4,4
"Walk in, and you see take out for pizza. Walk through the double doors, and you're in a fancy restaurant with a very nice atmosphere. The pictures don't do it justice.

Love the free bread with olive oil, crushed garlic, and cilantro.

Loved the ravioli, topped with real sausage and stuffed with ricotta cheese. The whole thing was delicious.",4,5
"Every time I went to Imperial Woodpecker this last summer, the waits were ungodly and most of their flavors were out. I don't even go there anymore, just head straight to Hansen's.",2,1
"I went in about 20 minutes ago. All three employees acted as if they were high. Also, I watched one of them double dip into the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ice cream (in front of me) with the same spoon and eat off of it about 7 or 8 times. I was the only costumer in there and he clearly didn't care. Made me appalled at what they would do to the ice cream if I wasn't standing there. It is DISGUSTING. I hardly write negative reviews but this is unacceptable!!!!!",1,1
"We were just passing through this area and found this restaurant with the help of Yelp.  We Would have never seen the place from the road and even if we had, we wouldn't have stopped because it's in a somewhat cruddy strip plaza. The inside pics on yelp are what persuaded us to check it out. And we are definitely glad we did. The food was very good.  Not the best BBQ ever, but good enough that I would go back again when we are in this area.  The interior is  tastefully decorated in a western theme. The servers were very nice and took good care of us :). I took one star off for just a few reasons: needs a vestibule as mentioned in another review; would be great if they served alcohol (but it is byob); and I would have liked at least one more BBQ sauce option at the table (like Carolina sauce). The meats were all very good (we had pork, chicken and kielbasa) and the granny's slaw was surprisingly good. I prefer a cream slaw but this was not at all tart. It had a really good taste - kind of like a mix between slaw and sauerkraut if you can possibly imagine that.",4,4
"This place was recommended by friends and we were highly disappointed.  $7 for 2 bland tacos, had to pay for chips and salsa (which was the best part of the visit) and the margarita wasn't so hot...won't return.",2,2
"So let me start off by saying that the food here was good enough for me to visit twice while I was visiting the area. I had the fried catfish and grits and biscuits and the second time the steak and eggs with grits. My biggest issue was with the wait stuff who were unprofessional and not welcoming. The service got worse after someone from our party didn't like her original order and asked for something different. The wait staff all took offense and I could visibly see and hear them discussing our table. As I watched them, two waitresses were eating while plating food (gross) I than lost my appetite.",2,2
"Three words....DON'T DO IT!!!!!

Just because somebody puts the word ""Diner"" on the front of a building, does not make it a Diner.

The basic tenets of a diner is good food, quality preparation, low cost, and good service. The only thing going for my meal was the waitress and the coffee.

 I ordered pork chops and eggs for dinner. When I tell you that the pork chops were swimming in grease, I am not exaggerating. It was so bad, I had to get several napkins to dry them off and a separate plate. How are fried eggs and home fries also swimming in grease? When I say swimming, I mean 1/8 of an inch of grease on the bottom of both plates.

It literally turned my stomach.

The waitress was fantastic, however. She kept checking on me, and when she saw that I was not enjoying or could even eat the food, she offered to get me something else. I reordered something simple like a grilled cheese with bacon, and it to was drenched in grease.

 I would not go back, and I would not recommend it. how previous reviewers gave it 4 stars, I don't know. I am a diner master, and this is no diner.",1,1
"I came here because I was getting my car inspected (on a lease) and wanted a wash and vacuum above what you would do it yourself. I opted for the magazine wash which was $18 which included interior vacuum and wipe down. I had specifically asked for vacuuming of the seats as I had fostered a dog and got dog hair everywhere. However there was still dog hair left after. It didn't seem like the interior was wiped down but that honestly could be hard to tell. The magazine wash was said to include an air freshener which I didn't get and the car actually smelled a bit musty after for some reason. Overall the wash did its job. But for the same price, I've gotten a much better car wash so not sure if I'll be returning.",3,2
"What a cool intro to Sonoran Mexican food. Although I was told this food is not healthy, I threw caution to the wind because I'm not sure when I will return to this area.

So it should not surprise anyone that I had a huge chimichanga: El Charro Carne Seca, enchilada style. The enchilada style was recommended by the waiter, and he was right. Without that cheese on top, it would have been dry. Lots and lots of umami from the beef! But it was a bit oversalted for me. This did not stop me from eating 2/3 of this monster, mind you.

The complimentary chips and salsa were quite good. The texture of the tortillas was thick enough that they seemed homemade, and like I was getting full on bread and not just a junky appetizer.

I did lean into my greedy with the caramel flan for dessert. Best flan I've ever had. I never knew it could be so satisfying.

Throw in seeing a friend after almost 10 years, and this was definitely a meal to remember.

We had dinner on the patio. It had cooled down a bit. But the downside is patio dining exposés you to the lovely local wildlife...insects. I saw a huge something creep around the patio, so this startled me a bit. Who knew you could beat Louisiana in the ""size of bugs"" category!

The service was actually really good. Our server was helpful and seemed young but also mature. He didn't hover too much which is always a plus. He did comment that I was all dressed up, like a lawyer... I explained I was in the area for a conference and LOLed internally. I'm a nurse for one, and two, y'all, I really don't think I was, but Tuscon seems like a pretty casual place. I have always claimed my native southerner, but I think maybe I've lived on the east coast too long, hence the uptight, lawyerly vibe. But simultaneously, this would make some of my uptight, lawyerly-but-also-southern family members beam with pride: I clearly have been assimilated on multiple fronts.",4,5
"Came here on a Sunday night after a Saints game And we put our name in for a private little cubby area with a TV.  when our name was called we started walking over to the lounge area. immediately a waitress came over and asked me what I was doing and I told her our name was called but I wasn't sure what table we were to be seated at because my husband was closing out our tab at the bar, Then A manager came over and told us we had to put our name in and I explained to him that our name was called I was just unsure what table we were to be seated at, and again he went to get a third manager and made us feel like we were not welcome there. Then the manager and the waitress  assigned to a table looked over and they started talking about us, and never came over to apologize for the mixup. Totally unprofessional and unorganized wait staff. If you don't look like you have a lot of money to spend you will not be treated with the respect that you deserve. Do not waste your money on this place.  Our waitress was Chloe.",1,1
"Great service 
They replaced my old tire very quickly at a very good price. 
I highly recommend them .",5,5
"Perfect place to stop after yoga on the banks! Between the iced coffee and the water tap with still and sparkling water, my thirsty was super satisfactorily quenched. Love the location so close to Rittenhouse Square makes for a superlative drinking & chatting & people watching experience.",5,5
"There was a time not too long ago where I said the F. Nazi served the best falafel in the city. However, the last couple of times left me disappointed and confused.  
Before, I didn't mind paying $10, sitting thru his bragadocious behavior, and waiting in line for half an hour since his food was so delicious.  Instead of getting tender grilled chicken with rosemary and perfectly fried falafel, I've been getting dry chicken and burnt falafel with purple goop sauce over withered lettuce.
Instead, head over to Mama's for a better foodie experience.",2,2
"Came for friday lunch. 

The decor is nice. The service was decent. The sushi was meh. Meh and overpriced. I'm (somewhat) ok with paying more for good sushi or less for meh sushi but paying more for meh?  No thanks. 

My problem with the sushi was threefold. First, and least important, I came with a group and we each ordered our own dishes (separate cheques) and it came out family style. That was annoying but whatever. 

Second, the fish. It was old and tough. Why am I paying so much for old, tough fish??  The octopus was nearly jerky by the time it was actually served. I had several other fishes too, they were all old. 

Third, the rice was terrible. Rice can make or break sushi and their rice was bland and packed too hard. That on top of the fish jerky made for a much more of a masticular workout than sushi should ever be. 

Lastly: insta-pack miso soup. Why, just why???

The search for quality sushi continues...",3,2
"Every time i come here it's at least a 3hr wait on an oil change, ridiculous.

The only reason i do come here is because it's close to my house and 5 minute doesn't rotate tires with oil changes.",2,2

"Love my Skinny Vanilla Latte.  Always have quick, friendly and accurate service. I also love the outside seating.  One of the better Starbucks locations.  The new decor is nice.",4,5
"Some dishes were memorable, while others I hope to soon forget. Their chips and guacamole were amazing! Unfortunately the azteca late summer vegetables salad did not deliver.I don't know where they get their  vegetables from, but they lacked any flavor. My wife did find her scallops ceviche enjoyable, though forgetable. I ordered the ensalada for my third course, and was very underwelmed. My wife ordered the empanadas which were delicious, but there was a very smoky sauce over them that I did not enjoy. My wife and I both loved our entrees: the chicken carnitas and hanger steak. The tortillas were authentic, and the flavor was excellent. My only complaint was the return of that smoky sauce to the hanger steak. The desserts, the mango flan and apple crisp manzano were equally delicious. My biggest disappointment was the choice of music in the restaurant. They played everyday American music, instead of sexy, sensual Latin music that would have complimented their authentic dishes.",3,4
"FedEx - are they daffy or just underhanded? 

Last week I went into the FedEx office and i got 12 scans for around 8 dollars.  Today I received 2 scans for $4.37 with a manager and an employee helping me out!   

How did this happen?  Well, the first time I gave an employee my flash drive and the pages to scan. And this person did it well and even redid a page she felt could be done better, no charge.

The second time, an employee named Sade told me that I needed to use the self serve station.  I told her last time a person did it for me. She said that person made a mistake, that we don't do that here.  And that the instructions were right at the station it's only 45 cents a minute and no charge for the scans!  Wow, sounds like a bargain.

So when I put in my credit card the self-serve station began charging me te  $0.45 per minute.  However I could not see where the instructions were.  Long story short, there were so many steps none of it was clear, and EVEN WITH MANAGER (NAMED HAMADI) jumping in and moving fast to finish the session,  it took 9.7 minutes which is $4.37.  

If that wasn't bad enough...

When I told them the manager, Mr. Hamadi, that the last time i was there an employee did it for me and charged me 80 cents a scan. He said, YES THAT I HAD THE OPTION TO DO IT. Then the employee (Sade) spoke up and said no-one told her that, that she was told to direct people to the stations.  Then the manager says yes, we suggest they go to the stations for privacy reasons.  

So I get privacy by giving Fed Ex my credit card info and scanning on their computer? 

I asked for a refund so i could go to back the counter and get the 2 scans for 80 cents each.  I did not want the ""no charge for scan"" deal.  However Mr. Hamadi the manager said he couldn't do that, but he'd be happy to scan anything else I needed for free.

Another deal!  When i completely run out of work that they can overcharge me on they will be happy to do the rest for free. 

Seriously, it is not just this manager's fault with the poor training given to the employee -, and the daffy responses he was instructed to give.  Imagine how much money Fed ex makes on work stations across the country with poor instructions. Go to your local not corporate copy place and get the fixed price instead of the deal.",1,1
"This is one of my favourite Starbucks in the city. It is also my most frequented since it is on my way to and from work. I stop here usually 2-3 times a week for a snack or great coffee. I only usually go through the drive thru but the staff is really good at taking accurate and quick orders. The wait time is very minimal most of the time. 

The staff are really friendly and I have yet to have a bad drink here. The prices and selection is the standard Starbucks selection. On the inside they have a ""Bar"" seating area by the windows so you can look out at the Calgary Trail traffic. There is a large community table with power outlets for electronics and they have free wifi which is nice. The store isn't usually super busy but it depends on the time of day you go. 

In the summer time they have tables and chairs outside on their small patio area so customers can enjoy the weather. 

They also have a twitter account and usually tweet about specials or sales going on in the store which I think is a great way to reach out to their customers. 

I am a Starbucks addict and I will be back again. Probably after I finish this review.",5,5
"I literally drive around in the summer with the air conditioning on just so I can sip my hot coffee from this place. I worked at a coffee shop and would still come here after work to drink and pay for this coffee instead. 
The owner is so friendly, remembers faces, and you can tell he is passionate about delivering his customers quality coffee. All the workers are nice as well. 
This is BY FAR the best coffee in Reno, and my favorite almond milk latte I've ever had. 

If I could give more stars I would, 100%",5,5
At a seminar seminar catered by Crocodile Catering. Coffee weak as water. Bagels ice cold & rubbery. All around left a bad taste in my mouth.,2,1
Around the side of the building but worth the look.  Great cook who cares.  Personal service is great.  Made up salsa when my husband asked for some for eggs.  Whole experience was great.,5,5
"Great location and ambiance, yes. Food however is just OK. Certainly not 4 stars. Of course everything tastes better when you've been drinking heavily all afternoon.",3,3
Finally found my spot!!!! The food is kinda ridiculously good!! And the platting is exceptional!!!!! I heard it was the same owners that own los arroyos but this place is 10 times better than los arroyos!! And I highly recommend saving room for dessert because their flan is impressively good!!! Their churros are perfectly crunchy! And their plantain is to die for!!!!!! Also I tried their esquite and it's not loaded in Mayonnaise! Pretty impressed by this place and definitely going back!!!!,5,5
Awesome pizza! Highly recommend. It's in a small little shop but it was excellent. We noticed it from the small outside seating they have. We're just visiting from KC but would come back! Seriously good pizza.,5,5
"Deserving of all 5 star reviews. When I moved to West Philly, my friend brought me here because he'd been wanting to go. I was so happy he did because with an uninteresting and undescriptive name like Mood Cafe, I'm not certain I would have come in anytime soon.

The service is fast and friendly and the food is a gigantic and pleasant surprise. Bountiful flavors, meshing and contrasting textures, color, and novelty. No one's heard about chaat and it's unfortunate because it's so tasty. I love to introduce this place to others because they deserve the attention.",5,5
"The waitress was great. Other than that, the place is not very good. The owners need to figure out if it's a sports bar, a club, or a restaurant and bar. 

The food and drinks are over-priced. Way over-priced. The music is loud to the point where it's hard to talk to the people across the table.  We sat at a table with a couch on one side and chairs on the other.  Terrible arrangement.

I wanted to like it because I heard people from FSU are behind it (May be true, may not be true), but it's just not good. Maybe try a college town (Tampa is not a college town).",1,2
"We came here on Sunday December 29th, 2013 and we had a VERY LARGE dinner party. We sat out on the covered patio section and we had an amazing time. The staff was super amazing in dealing with our large and loud crowd, they showed patience and professionalism. 

We did the family style for many reason, mainly to help the staff and we loved each course that was chosen. The portions were generous and being BYOB made it even better. We started with salads and calamari for appetizers and they were delish. The past with lobster in pink sauce was my absolute favorite dish. The veal parm was thin, flavorful and decadent. The fish option we had that was served in a lemon white wine sauce was crispy on the outside, juicy and perfectly prepared. 

We had so many dessert options like Tiramisu, cheesecake and canoli's and they were just all great. We all had a great time because they accommodated us. I'm a fan and I would definitely return if I'm ever in this area considering its quite a distance from Philadelphia.",4,5
"Somehow, in my studies of the Circle City, its history, and inhabitants, I missed out on the fact that George Thomas was running a floral empire from the east side of town. Having contracted over the years from multiple locations to one at 10th & Shadeland, this summer GeoTom relocated to the heart of Irvington. The rehabbed interior of a vacant storefront is part flower shop, part warehouse chic, and these people know their petals. Make your own arrangements or trust their judgement, either way you'll leave happy. They deliver all over central Indiana, too, so give them a call even if you can't stop by in person.",5,5
soooooo good. the apple tini was more like watermelon. got one of everything. service was just ok. the calamari was killer. ya id come back. great happy hour too,5,4
Havnt tried food but great for whiskeys and not crazy over priced. Nice inside. Cocktails looked good,4,4

"I love camping here with my laptop and a latte for a couple of hours, especially the past several weeks when I've had to finish writing my dissertation.

My lattes have always been spot on -- can't wait to try the food next time.",5,5

"After scouring half of midcity and uptown for a dog groomer that is reasonable and can take my pets in on my two days off, I stumbled across Fluffy Mutts and I am so glad I did! 

I'm a paramedic and I work a weird schedule. Half the places I called around in uptown and midcity only did dog grooming on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Working a 3-2 split, my off days this week were only
Monday and Tuesday. Needless to say, everywhere I called around to had an extensive wait list, a pricey grooming fee, and picky days in which I was not available. 

I called Fluffy Mutts on Saturday to schedule a grooming for my female American cocker spaniel and my male cavalier/cocker spaniel mix. Both had been needing a good haircut for sometime and even though I was prepared to pay a fortune, nobody could take me on the following Monday or Tuesday. I guess you have to be on a dog royalty list in order to get in at these places midtown or uptown. Anyways, I called Fluffy Mutts on Saturday and spoke with Jose, whom was informative and flexible. He was open and was willing to take both pups with open arms at any time i choosed. 

Come monday, at 0900 I bring my dogs in to a very clean and modern place . The front desk is a dog bone. How cool is that?! It's a pretty huge place with not a lot of seemingly unimportant sale items scattered about. In fact, it's pretty empty and to the point. It doesn't even smell like animals are in the building! Which is a nice plus since there are tons of places where you are just overwhelmed with the smell of dog as soon as you walk through the front door. 

A nice gentleman, Jose is at the front desk. He asks about the pups, we sign a couple papers, normal grooming information like the dog(s) name, your name, phone number, vet, ect. And my pups are taken to the back which is not hidden. I was allowed to walk back with my dogs into an area that had several sized kennels. There was only one other dog in small kennel, and I helped him put my two pups in a huge shared kennel until they were ready for grooming. Jose was extremely nice and well spoken. He asked a few questions about the pups sensitive areas and temperament. He also took a few minutes to kneel down with each pup and introduce himself. 

Now, I have been in the habit of shaving and grooming my female cocker since she was 6 weeks old. So she is relaxed during bath times and shaving sessions. My boy dog isn't so much the same. He is hyper, hates sitting for long periods of time, and basically is wild. So, I planned on forking out a few extra bucks for the trouble the groomer has to go through with him. 

Around 1300, Jose calls and says both puppies are done and ready to be picked up. I arrive at the groomer with much anticipation and embarrassment because I'm feeling a little uneasy about how my boy dog may have acted. Jose met us at the desk again calmly.  He told us my female cocker could give a damn about the grooming session but my male was definitely some work. Thus, is what I expected to hear. The grooming for both of them which included a film haircut, bath, ears, nails, and anal gland was 45.00 each. I was shocked! Seeming as though I was preparing to pay a fortune, fluffy mutts has some pretty cute bandanas and bows for
Sale on the front desk for real cheap. Some were 2.00 and the special ones were 4.00. You can't beat that price! The Saints bandana was 4 bucks which is much cheaper than any pet store I have been to! And it's reversible! 

Anyways, the puppies looked great! Both of them! Even though he had to fight with my boy dog, I don't think my boy dog's haircut could look any better! He has a nice solid equal full shave with no gaps or razor burns! They both also smell great and their coats look amazing! I can't express the gratitude I have for this place! It's only 3 miles from midcity. It's fast. It's quality. And it definitely gets my recommendation. This will be my dog
groomer for the remainder of my New Orleans residency. 

Thank you so much Jose!!!!",5,5

"This place is so cool and so good!! Food was amazing ! We were so full when we left. 25$ for a 7 course meal, can't beat it. They serve drinks but it also is BYOB. When you get there you have to knock to get in and then once seated they wash your hands in rose water ( smelled so good) you eat with your hands to ! The food was out of this world. We wanna try different things and this was one on the list! So happy we went . Oh and a belly dancer came thru out the rooms and gave you a show!",5,5
"After a few days of suffering from a pretty persistent fried chicken craving, I finally caved and came to The Fat Ham to try their version of Hot Chicken... it was pretty darn hot and hit the spot!

Pros - friendly service, nice drink variety (cocktails, wine, and beers on draft), delicious house hot sauce, and generally tasty Southern food. I also really enjoyed the comfortable decor/ ambience, especially the quirkiness of using mismatched patterned plates! So cute!

Cons - small portion sizes (for example, the HC = two pieces of fried chicken on one thin slice of brioche). Think fancy Southern small-plates and maybe you won't feel as put-off. Also, while the food was probably the prettiest Southern food I've seen, some dishes were underwhelming in the flavor department.

Favorites - oyster sliders, hot chicken, and the sweet potato pie. If in the area, I would come again for a casual drink and these three dishes.",3,4

"Heard that Benton Park was in the path of totality today, and I have been wanting to try this place ever since I discovered Melo's next door, so I killed two birds with one stone.  Let me tell you, it was life changing ..... and I ain't talking about the eclipse, although that was good too.  I am actually not a sandwich or deli kinda guy, but that may have changed after today.  I had the St. Louis Primo and it was absolutely delicious!  Everything was so fresh and flavorful.  I honestly have never had a sandwich this good in St. Louis, not even on the Hill.  The guy at the counter, who I presume was one of the owners from the way he talked, was super nice.  The food only took a couple of minutes.  Seating is limited.  I would say go during a time when it wasn't busy, but I don't know if that will exist again until another eclipse and trust me, you don't want to wait that long to try this place.",5,5
Be prepared for low quality and a very long wait here. This place can't keep workers and management changes monthly. This last time I went inside and wish I had not because it was filthy and I saw employees not using gloves. Touching money then making food with their bare hands - it takes a lot to gross me out but this place needs serious guidance. Maybe a call to the State Board of Health will get them on track.,1,1
"We went for lunch. I didn't even know this place was here . . . it's been here 10 years. Oh, well -- I know now, AND they've got private parking!! Score in Clayton!!

We got a table for four, with just two of us . . . something I do so appreciate. We had our coats, our purses, all of which had their own ZIP codes! Good room.

This is a white linen place, although I did notice a more casual seating of tables in the bar area.

There were a lot of businessmen lunching here. And two large groups in private rooms.

We got water and just stuck with that. Then the bread with black olive tapenade. Absolutely divine. The Italian bread was toasted just right with perfect crunch. The tapenade was oh so tasty!

My dining partner has been here numerous times, so I asked her for a recommendation. She absolutely adores the chicken parmesan, and she recommended the lobster ravioli.

The chicken parmesan was a large piece of chicken perfectly topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then broiled. It came with a couple large potato wedges (grilled?) and a vegetable combination of green beans and carrots. It looked delicious!

I did get the lobster ravioli, and it was really good. Triangle-shaped raviolis in a rich brandy creme sauce. There were some peas and other vegetable additions, such as onion, artichoke and tomato. Plentiful serving.

We both had to-go vessels.

Service was attentive. Waters filled before they were empty.",4,5
"Just wanted to take a moment to commend the staff of Tuna Bar for their professionalism and hospitality during an unfortunate power outage this evening. Despite the entire block and their whole building losing power (absolutely beyond their control), the owner and staff went above and beyond to ensure that we had a meal that was savory and special. We were beyond impressed with their service and dedication to their customers. Having been to this restaurant several times since it's opening, even with the power out, the food was fresh, flavorful and 100% satisfying. The tuna crudo and the rock shrimp are items we will continue to order as long as they serve them. The sashimi style fish was a delight to have served simply, as to properly enjoy the freshness of the ingredients. We will continue to come back again and again. Thank you to the owner and staff!!",5,5
There is really nothing you can say about this place other than yum!  I've tried many tacos and they are all delicious as well as their salsas and margs!  I do wish their inside dining area was larger but other than that - the perfect cheap and delicious quick dinner out.,4,5
"I come here for the Sangria-rita. Never thought sangria mixed in a margarita could be so delicious. And, now I know it exist and that it's super amazing, I'm hooked. Reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the food items are just good and not great.",4,4

The service is really great here.  The coffee is roasted fresh (you can see their roaster working behind the counter).  Just a really great all around neighborhood bakery and lunch shop.",4,5
"I stay in hotels about 35 nights a year.  This is a standard issue Courtyard.  However, it is an older property that needs updating.  (worn furniture, older TV, etc.)  I agree with previous reviewers - it would have been nice to have the breakfast included considering the location and quality of the hotel.  

It is in a decent shopping center with a Starbucks and few restaurants.  It is pretty far from the downtown area, maybe a 10-15 minute drive.  It is pretty close to Atlantis and Peppermill.  Lots of other restaurants nearby.

Staff seemed very nice and friendly (although one appeared to be far from valedictorian).",3,3
"I have never written a review for a restaurant before, but after the birthday party we just endured there, I felt I had to let others know about this place. 
     First off, let me say that we visited this place almost a year ago and were very impressed. The food was delicious, hot, and fresh, there was hardly anybody in the place (we walked right on all the rides), and the games were fun. So we decided to have my son's birthday party there.
     The place that we walked into was not the same as when we had been there before. It looked the same, but nothing else was the same. Our party time was at 4; we waited for 15 minutes for our host to tell us our room was ready and then we were escorted back to our party room. We began getting our food from the buffet, and I noticed right away that the food was not the same as before. It was still pizza, but it tasted horrible. I think cardboard would have tasted better. My brother in law came back with a ""loaded baked potato"" wrapped in foil, only to open it up and discover that it was just a plain baked potato. 
      The hostess seemed in a hurry for us to finish eating, which seemed a bit odd, but we waited until everyone finished and then sang Happy Birthday and cut and served the cake. Everyone ate their cake while my son opened his presents. The hostess once again approached us and said that we needed to hurry because we only had a few minutes left (the time was 5:19). The package we paid for gave us the party room for 90 minutes. Seeming as they were not ready for us at 4 (which was our scheduled time), you would think that they would allow us to have the room for a full 90 minutes (until 5:45). But we had to argue with the hostess and explain to her multiple times that it was not our fault we got in the room late. We had gotten to the place at 3:50 and were ready, but another party ran late. This should not be our problem, and we should get the full amount of time we paid for. So the hostess went off to talk to a manager, came back, and, begrudingly told us we could have the party room until 5:45. My son finished opening his presents, and we left the room at 5:42.
      Included in the party package we purchased were: a spin on the Incredible Prize Wheel for the birthday boy (which we didn't get to do), 100 free tickets for the birthday boy (which we didn't get), and a balloon bouquet (which when I asked if we could take from the table, the hostess said that we had to leave it there for the next party). We did get the party room and hostess for 90 minutes, even though we had to argue to get these and the Incredible Birthday Song.
      For this entire party, we paid over $198. Pretty expensive for such a hassle if you ask me.
      Next, we went into the gaming area, which was PACKED. There is no other way to describe it. We're talking, you literally can't move at times because there are just people everywhere. There are unsupervised children running everywhere. If I had a nickel for every small child that I saw without a parent, I would be rich by now. 
      The lines for the go karts and laser tag were ridiculously long. My husband timed how long they stood in line for laser tag, and it was 53 minutes. Go karts was a little better at 47 minutes, but not by much. 
       Before we started, we asked the information booth people which things were considered ""attractions"" because each card we were given with our package had $10 for the games and 2 free attractions. The lady at the booth told us the attractions were the go karts, bumper cars, laser tag, mini golf, and bowling. Funny because when we scanned our card for bowling, it took off money instead of using one of our attractions. When I brought this to the attention of the information lady, she stated that there was nothing she could do about it. So we lost $5.50 off our cards for my 2 sons to bowl right away, instead of it being free as we were told it was.
       After we visited a few attractions, we began playing games. As stated before, we were supposed to have 100 free tickets for the birthday boy. The way they do these cards is that you get one card for each party guest. It had $10 for games and 2 free attractions loaded on each card. Once you get tickets in a game, it automatically loads them onto the card for you so you don't have to carry around a bunch of tickets. This is nothing but a ripoff, as we soon discovered. 
        Our 3 sons played with 6 of these cards (2 each). We helped them keep track of how many tickets they had and at the end of the night, we took them to the prize counter to redeem. We had well over 2000 tickets between the 6 cards, not counting the 100 free tickets. The lady at the counter scanned our cards and came up with a grand total of...560! We were completely speechless. It was 9:00 PM by this point, and we were tired and ready to go home, so we were ready to just accept it. CONTINUED ON THE NEXT RATING...",1,1
They are running a grand opening special that made my pedicure less than $35.  The waiting area was comfortable and the staff was attentive and kind. I will definitely go back.,5,5
"Didn't try the cannoli but ogled one someone was buying. Guess I'll have to go back. 

Did try some kind of strawberry cake, mostly pink icing with white edges and pink swirls in the cake but no actual strawberries. That's fine, I don't like actual strawberries... just things that taste like them. The cake was good, dense but not in a moist way. (I know I just used the m-word but I think it should be allowed when discussing cake.) The frosting had a great consistency, not overwhelmingly sweet but real (sugary) frosting. I can't stand that whipped/non-dairy BS they use in grocery stores. $2 for a slice.

Friend had a slice of the chocolate mousse cake but she and I both agreed the mousse had a kind of alcoholic taste.. I guess from a chocolate liqueur or something. It was still edible but I don't think I'd get it again.",4,4
"We tried to eat here today.
We waited to be seated for 10 minutes.
No one acknowledged any of us waiting to be seated.
There were at least 3 empty tables but no one ever cleaned it off so the new people can be seated.
  
Absolutely no management!

Sat afternoon at 12:30 pm
There should have been more than 2 wait staff and 1 cook for this restaurant.

We went to another pizza place close by and had a wonderful luch!
We walked there ordered ate our awesome pizza and salad walked back and some folks were still standing waiting to be seated. 

This is sad.",1,1
This is one of the worst restaurants in Indiana..had ordered karadi paneer and they came with Sahi paneer ..than they apologized and came with Sahi paneer which was made in 5 minutes..fully burn..won't recommend anyone,1,1
"I was so excited when California Tortilla decided to open in Phoenixville! This is by far my favorite location and I have not had a bad experience yet. The staff is extremely friendly and always helpful. The food has always been fresh and delicious! Also, they have great vegetarian and vegan options. You can't go wrong stopping into this California Tortilla for a bite to eat. Personally I love their veggie and bean tacos!",5,5
"I've used them several times for HP laptop repair.  They have a quick turn around, are reasonably priced and have fixed the problems I was having.  I haven't used them for any Apple products repair though so cannot comment on that.",5,5
"Milktooth is too legit. Too legit to quit.

Let me tell you why it's legit... they serve sparkling water with their espresso. As my Italian dining companion explained, this is how it's done in Rome. 

Have you seen the froth art of the cappuccinos at this joint?! Works of art. Follow them on Instagram and you will see. I don't drink coffee so I cannot assure you personally of how great they are, but everyone was raving about the cappuccino where they put Capt'n Crunch berries in the mix for added sweetness.

So today was my first time dining at Milktooth. Initially they said it was an hour wait. Not an issue, as there's a coffee bar to belly up to that offers local coffee, teas, and pasteries. The wait ended up only being thirty minutes as we were offered a seat at the diner style counter top.

The menu is so unique here! Items from influences all over the world... miso soup, latkes, belgian waffles, etc. There's even an offering of oysters.

After much debating we decide on the quinoa grits loaded with egg, scallion and bacon, latkes with sour cream and apple sauce, and a waffle with apples, creme fraiche, bacon, nuts and cocoa. Oh my, oh my.... that waffle is going to haunt me for weeks to come. So, so good. The waffle was the consistency of a croissant, not at all tough and not burnt. The creme fraiche added just the right sweetness to offset the tart apples. My second favorite was the quinoa grits. The egg was runny perfection, and the bacon was a great texture contrast to the grits. Of these two items we finished every morsel. The latkes were just ok, but then again they are sort of meant to be plain in their rightful state. 

The service was very good. Someone noticed us holding our coats and asked to take them for us. Our server was attentive. It was impressive considering how busy it was for brunch (11:30am). Also everyone that works here is very attractive. Is this, like, the new Hooter's for Hipsters? If so, I love the concept. 

Speaking of aesthetics.... the atmosphere is the perfect combo of thrift shop meets diner but in a whitewashed wall sort of way. I'm pretty sure the chandelier's above the coffee bar are from an old church. Gold and grand swaying above a concrete counter top is a combo I swoon for. The garage doors of the old converted building brings in lots of sunlight. I can't wait for summer when the doors are up and the street can meet this culinary masterpiece.

To sum this up: I will be back to Milktooth very soon, but likely during the week for lunch until the new-ness dies down. 

And to the other reviews about portion size. I left full, not stuffed. Plus, creativity is a quality, not quantity thing. This place has plenty of quality.",5,5
The only thing this place had somewhat right was the GUAC. Service was terrible. Kids food is so spicy my child wouldn't take more than a bite. Queso had to have been warmed up from a box. I'm pretty sure the same spices are used on everything they serve. We ordered appetizers and it literally took 45 minutes after they came out to order entrees which we skipped since the apps were so bad. I could understand (not really) if it was a busy night but there were only about 6 tables. I really do not like writing bad reviews and I really dislike writing bad reviews on Mexican food since it's my fave but this place needs to get it together.,2,1
"This is both about the location at 2nd and South Streets (not listed on Yelp as well as the responsiveness of the parent corporation when I used their website to contact them and - after 2 weeks - received no reply.
The 2nd Street location is staffed by young people who are obviously not ""customer oriented"". I went in two weeks ago with a gift certificate for $10 and planned to spend it all. They had prepackaged quarts in the freezer of the chocolate flavor that looked good. The price was $6.00. On the price board they listed prices as Pint: $6.00; Quart $8.00. Since they had no hand dipped chocolate flavors I asked if I could buy the two frozen pints for $8.00. After all 2 pints equals a quart and they had no frozen quarts. The young woman - maybe 22 years old - who seemed to be the ""senior"" staff member (of two staff) said ""No, two pints would be $12.00"". I said - politely - ""but two pints make a quart, right? She replied, sarcastically, ""Yes, I know that. That's how we make money"".  What??
Well I bought ONE pint - since I had to use the certificate - and a non chocolate small cup (at $3.75) and used up my cert. I then went home and spent time emailing the incident to their corporate headquarters and as I said I've not received a reply.

I live in the neighborhood and it is rarely busy - heck Hagaan Daz is a block away and actually CHEAPER - and now I know why. They will not see me there again. Employees with attitudes like that can kill customer loyalty.",1,1
"Restaurant Week Review 

Let me start off by saying the view of the city from R2L is the best in town. That's about all it's good for though....5 stars for the view. 

We were sat an hour late because the hostess was looking for my friend in a ""red scarf"" to let us know our table was ready. And of course after a few drinks she took it off and you can guess the rest of the story. 

The food didn't come for an hour and it was very greasy, and bland. I actually had a meal off the regular menu being a veggie and all and it was terrible....seriously! It was some kind of spinach balls with other ""steamed"" veggies. It was greasy....no joke. My husband was not very pleased with his choice either off the Restaurant Week menu. The desert was just OK. 

If R2L was trying to hook you during Restaurant week they failed. I will only come back here for drinks. It really is just a glorified hotel Restaurant with spectacular views.",2,2
"The atmosphere and wait staff were increadible, our server ""Chris"" was very familiar with the ingredients and cooking style of each dish on the menu. I would have given 5 stars bit the salad was a little wilted with too much dressing. The house dressing is awesome so I didn't mind. Overall the best food and dinning experience i've had in a very long time.",4,4
"This is a very luxurious spot reminiscent of Manhattan. It's a really great first date destination if you want to seem like you are a cultured gent with great taste and an appreciation for fine wine,cheeses, and spiced nuts. Make sure you get your cash advance or title loan before you go here though because it's not cheap. Prices are typical for what you're getting atmosphere included.",4,4
"I took my car there for the 39.99 inspection.  They told me it would be 2 1/2 hours to complete. After about an hour the ""salesperson"" Lisa told me my total would 130. 00. That was for 3 bulbs on my license plate!! Then she proceeded to take me in the repair area where my tires were off and tell me I needed brakes, rotors and possibly a shock because it was old and looked like the original one. Oh yes also a tire rotation and alignment. This place is a scam. I had my car at the Kia dealer. ( 2013 Kia optima) 3 weeks prior for a check and recalls and they told me exactly what my brakes had left and they were fine. It was ready for inspection. So I paid the 130. Even though I knew I was scammed be ause if I didn't they would have failed me and I would of had to pay the 39.99 again. It's on the wall behind her desk.",1,1
Wish I lived in Boise for this restaurant. Delicious and affordable place I would have never found without yelp.,5,5
"OK, I would go 3.5 stars if they let me..... Typical pub food. A HUGE menu - which for me, makes it too hard to choose. They are known for their wings, and they do have good wings.... but the sauces are not true.... Their ""Ghost Pepper"" sauce isn't even as hot as Tabasco sauce. Like you could drink a 5oz. bottle and get just barely a bit of heat,

Burgers are good. Fish and Chips is good. Very busy during dinner hours.",3,3
"Ok, so I'm writing this review as I'm digging into Hip City Veg's Chick'n Fajita Wrap so I recap all the deliciousness.  First of all, it's huge! Great size for the price. I am a big supporter of these kind of establishments, but sometimes the servings are way too small, especially since it's all veggie.  The chick'n was cooked very well and had a great texture.  The chipotle creama is definitely worthy of praise.  So much spice and flavor!  Love.  The combo of the onions, peppers, pico de gallo, and avocado just make everything come together and please my tastebuds even further.  I love anything mexican/southwestern inspired, and this was perfect for my afternoon craving!
Some other noteworthy observations: since I went during lunch hour, there was a line and about 5 people in front of me, but one of the employees was out taking our orders before getting to the register. GENIUS! It helped that she was very pleasant as well.  This helped the flow of customers quickly get their grub and go.  Lastly, the iced green tea is very refreshing and slightly sweetened with agave nectar, so no need to worry about it being overly sweet or caloric (I think).
I definitley recommend this place to anyone, not just vegetarians.  Go!",5,5
I booked 1 night here at CDMI and I was very pleased and happy I chose this place for my last minute getaway. They were so friendly at the front desk during check in and helpful in finding a great parking spot at such a late hour. They served a nice little breakfast spread and also allow pets! I will definitely be back to stay and next time with my fur baby!:)),5,5
"I'm not a fan of fancy donut since it doesn't seem worth it but we decided to come and try it since we were so close.  Well, I'm glad we came! 

As soon as we got in line there was a big crowd behind us.  A wide variety of choices and unique combinations of flavors.  We just wanted to split 1 bc we had more places to eat later.  We got the blueberry cheesecake and a cold brew.  Absolutely wonderful.  1/2 of the donut was filling and I loved the cheesecake filling.  . 

Cold brew was also smooth and tasty.  Not enough time on vaca to eat everything.  

Yum.",4,5
"The place was empty on a Tuesday afternoon.  I arrived earlier than my best friend and I had planned for dinner.  The friendly hostess/waitress seated me at the corner table.  The waitress brought the coffee I asked for and asked if I wanted to order something as I waited.  I asked for the Yelp-famous potato latke.  Do I want sour cream, apple sauce or pear sauce with it?  I don't know... what do you recommend?  She loved the pearsauce.  She was right... the pearsauce went perfectly.

When it came to ordering my meal, I couldn't choose from the array of mouth watering options.  I ended up getting a couple sides - the mac n cheese and the green bean casserole.  I was more than extremely satisfied with my choices.  My friend got the vegetarian nachos.  Very tasty!  Her salad was very colorful and big portions.  

All in all... a very good experience.  I'll be going back again!",4,5
"quite simply the food was junk for the cost.  i had tempura and sushi which i thought would have been pretty standard fare.  the sushi had little to no taste to it and the tempura was nothing special.  they were also kind enough to charge my credit card twice...

"The Gaslight Theatre is fun for the whole family.  The music is fun and energetic.  The actors are hilarious and quirky and just flat make you smile.  Our waitress, Miranda, was pleasant, prompt and personable.  I highly recommend you checkout this dinner theatre.",5,5
"Chris found this little hidden gem of a food truck a couple of weeks ago. It took me a while to try it since the truck is only open during the week, but it was well worth the wait.

The Capt'n Crunch Tilapia Burrito is pretty amazing. The portion is generous and filling, making it hard to believe it's only $6.

The people working the truck are super friendly. They recently bought a larger food truck and have been expanding their menu. We're looking forward to trying all of the new menu items.",5,5
"For a motel, this is as good as it gets for the price we paid. Good location close to St. Louis, free wifi, and the best part was the ultra comfortable mattress. It was clean and did not smell of chemical cleaners as other motels I have experienced. Overall, good price and good sleep.",5,5
"Any place with the genius of making cows advertise for eating chicken is my kind of business.  But then again, I'm a fan of talking animal commercials, so consider the source.  That being said, not only is the chicken great here, but the location is SO in need of a great anchor fast food place.  Having experienced the unique flavors of Firehouse Subs wet steamed (read: wet) subs, Chick-Fil-A is a welcome break to the harried mom on a Saturday.  Kids nosh on white meat chicken that actually looks like chicken with real fruit sides and I can score a lower calorie but equally tasty grilled chicken and feed a troop of 4 for $20.
The place is super clean and by owner policy, no franchise is open on Sundays.  What really crushes this place though is the grown ups who run it.  They greet you by name, want to have a clean establishment and wholesome quick meal.  You won't see managers snapping at workers but rather pitching in.  Well done Mr. Fil-A.",5,5
"They gave me stones instead of paneer!! And the person at the counter says"" its the fault of the chef and not hers""",1,1
"Mary gives the best hair cuts I've ever gotten. I've been going here for a couple years now and I couldn't be happier with the consistently excellent service. Mary is very precise and attentive to my preferences. Unlike other hair salons that I've been to, she never tries to get me to buy their hair products or extra services. Also, the atmosphere in their studio is very comfortable and friendly; I feel welcome and promptly attended to every time I visit. 

I'll keep getting my hair cut here as long as I live in Philly. I found this place on Yelp and I'm happy to add to the several positive reviews that got me to go there in the first place. If you're looking for a new salon that will really cater to your preferences and help your hair look its best, I highly recommend that you give Mary and her team a try!",5,5
"Home of the $5.25 eggs benedict!

There aren't many places you can go to these days and pay $20 for breakfast for 3. Yanni is the perfect little diner to get your breakfast fix. Yes, I am fully aware that most of their clients are over the age of 65 but maybe we need to follow in their footsteps because they're on to something good here. 

We ate French Toast, 3 Eggs O'Brian (which is like a western omelet + home fries all scrambled up) & Eggs Benedict. The french toast was kinda mushy, like the way you might make it but not soggy - in other words, perfect. The 3 eggs o'brian turned out to be a favorite that I had to fight off my sisters to be able to eat my own dish. The eggs benedict is a solid EB and given the price, it's surely worth it.",3,5
"Best yelp reviews you will find in Reno.  But I always get a table!  This is my favorite place to eat in Reno.

"Wency is an incredible dog and puppy trainer,very intuitive and always has  positive solutions . She has helped me with all of my dogs with positive rewarding .  She has helped me solve some rather serious issues and I ended up with perfect dogs . I always feel like a better dog owner just talking to her and she's always available to help .

"One of the best meals I have ever had.  I had the grit souffle to start, followed by the trout, served over a perfect fried green tomato.  My husband had the corn bisque and the scallops.  The scallops were perfectly seared and not overdone.  For dessert, cookies and milk.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal!  Oh, and the cheddar biscuits in the bread basket are not to be missed!!!",5,5
"Attended a wedding this past weekend.  Found this little gem online and booked the last room for Saturday night.  We were able to check in early (around 1:30) when our room was ready.  Reception wasn't starting until 4pm, so we ventured over to the Harbor which is one block down to the water, and then a nice stroll along the marina to the restaurants/shops.  Room was nice, clean and very comfortable.  Bathroom was huge, super clean with nice amenities.  They offer a nice continental breakfast in the lobby with muffins, fruit, coffee, and juices.  We'd definitely recommend the Castillo Inn.",5,5
"Worst manicures and pedicures my family has ever had. The place looks nice and that's about it. Would rate them 0 starts if possible. The woman running the counter was obnoxious and yelling the whole time. Pretty sure we saw her drinking some wine when we walked in (drinking on the job??) and she had little knowledge of the products and services they provided. I used to work for a High end nail salon that puts this place to shame. I was required to know how all the services were done and what to processes were. 

My mother, sister and I went there to get mani pedis for a wedding and I am very embarrassed to show anyone my nails. All my nails are different lengths and shapes, and despite telling my tech Tina (wouldn't recommend her) NOT to make them shorter, she did so anyways. She had an obsession with filing too. It was as if she would just file more when she didn't know what to do. She filed THROUGH one of my nails which is now broken, and when she was removing my polish she was pressing so hard that she actually bent my natural nails which was quite painful. She also had to have two other people fix my nails for her because she didn't know how to do anything. Not to mention that the girl who had to fix my nail with gel didn't know what she was doing either or she was super new. The repairs look awful. The gel polish is all lumpy and uneven top and it looks super thinned down. My mother and sister finished 30 minutes before me and we all got the same thing and came in at the same time.  They only had ONE light for drying gels and three of us were getting gel manis??? Like, how does that make sense?? My tech also didn't give my nails enough time to dry as they are Still wet and squishy. My mother's tech broke and chipped a few of her nails and thought Acrylic and Gel were the same thing and refused to listen to my mother's requests. Her gel mani also has a bunch of bubbles too. They cut her many times and DESTROYED my little sisters feet. Her feet are all scraped up and she has raw parts on her feet with scabs now from where they filed her feet. Within just 30 minutes my sisters pedicure was almost completely gone and looked 2 weeks old. They didn't even trim her cuticle and they painted over them. 

The techs there have a serious attitude problem too. When my mother asked for them to use a file instead of the drill one of them piped up and said ""um we have to use it."" With a stuck up look. Rude. And when we asked for our money back for my sisters pedicure the woman sounded so desperate to keep our money and try to fix it and started yelling and arguing with us. She said ""No PLEASE give me a chance to fix it, just lemme fix it for you. It needs to be done. It has to be done. Please give me this chance. It will only take a moment well give you a different girl just let me fix it."" Like she was scared. It was really annoying. She insisted on giving us a gift card instead of giving us our money back which is useless since we will never be returning.  
Also just looked at my nail after writing this review  because it felt really sticky and now there's a huge finger print in my gel mani. Cool.

This place is just an over bedazzled pile of poop.",1,1
"We ended up eating here on a Sunday afternoon after leaving a long wait at another restaurant. I fell in love with this place the moment we entered. The music was great. The waitstaff was amazingly friendly. The vibe here is very trendy and chill. 

They have a nice assortment of drinks of the gourmet variety. They also feature that assortment of coffees and teas in addition to. The food was great. I had the club with the roasted potato salad. I could have that potato salad by itself it was so good! I would definitely come here again during the daytime. 

My rambling: I'm not quite sure, but I believe they do have a nice life also. I remember coming in here a while back during the evening, but it was too packed to enjoy on that night. I'm also not sure if it was under different ownership at the time. 

Either way, their lunches and refreshing drinks are amazing, tasty and fresh!",5,5
Rented a van for a weekend road trip and everything was great. Doug and team were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely use them again when we need a van.,5,5
"I came here Saturday night after hearing about the place for quite some time. I ordered the Baked Chicken Platter only to be told they don't have it.

I didn't want to try my luck with another platter so I opted for the Chicken Fingers and an order of fries. After I paid a few minutes later I was told they are out of fries and I got my money back for the fries.

Overall experience could be better, don't know why the full menu wasn't available Saturday night. Also it would have been nice to check if you had fries before you took my money.

Chicken Fingers were good, but the service is mediocre.

Will try them again to see if they improve.",3,3
"Finally made it! My husband and I have been wanting to try the Depot for quite some time now. Often we would forget because of the time we chose to eat or we had already set our sites on something else.

   My husband had the Classic Burger and side dish macaroni and cheese. 
I had the Flat Iron Steak with Bacon Mashed Potatoes and asparagus. We tried each other's food and both of us were very happy and ate up like cows! I did anyway, I was starving! 

   The burger was light, not heavy or too greasy. It actually tasted and seemed healthy so to speak. The Mac and Cheese with bacon seemed light also. I can't seem to articulate my thought. It was simple tasting like boxed mac and cheese?? But not a boxed low quality!!! We both liked it!! 
  Fries were very good also. Cut and cooked semi thick and crispy. Perfect! ...and house made ketchup. Mashed potatoes were amazing, as was the flank steak. A cheap steak made to taste as if otherwise. 

 Customer service was just ""okay."" The server (didn't get her name) was very nice however I little bit flaky. We did request another classic burger to go before we left and she was on top of that! When ready to leave she brought out the burger we were bummed we had forgotten to order in a more timely manner. Toward the end of the meal, there were a few things forgotten upon request but not enough to complain. 

  We sat outside though we looked around before sitting down. Very cool atmosphere. Well designed, two kitchens I think... Two bars, both upstairs and downstairs. When using the restroom, I think I heard what might be a train sound effect??? Because it used to be a train station...? 

 Needless to say, we will be back very soon! It will now probably be one of our regular rotations.",5,5
"This place was nice per locals is a good place for some fast yet filling food. My family of 4 came into the restaurant and was greeted warmly by the cashier whom I also think is the owner. He made sure to alert us of all specials,   and was a pleasure from the beginning. He totally made the dining experience pleasant. The menu has a few sea food options, chicken wings , and etc. The lot is big so parking was easy. You can take out, dine in,or dine outside on the patio. Decor was nice and very clean. Pricing was fair not expensive. Featured meals of the day as well as current promotions. I would definitely return I am a fan of good service and I left feeling that my money and presence was appreciated. And for that I am appreciative.",4,5
"Went to the rib cook off on a Saturday evening. What a bad idea because that was everyone else's intent as well. I loved the free shuttles that were provided to and from the event. They were efficient, prompt, and painfree. The vendors that participated were amazing! Chicago BBQ was my all time fave with BJ's being a close second. The only thing that made this experience painful was the crowd. I get it's free admission, but I spent 2 hours walking around like a herd of cattle. It was a fun experience, but I think one time is enough for me.",3,4
"The bartenders are great! Get the pulled pork grilled cheese! Happy hour is great, though the sliders are a tad dry. The Mac n cheese is yummy though!",5,4
"I've been here multiple times due to its convenient location and have left disappointed every time. I've been serviced by every barber that works here.  

I like my hair to be cut relatively short and every single time, without fail, I've had to deal with attitude from the barbers when I asked them to cut it shorter than what they wanted. Look, I'm not insulting your skill or anything, I just like my hair cut short! I even had one flat out refuse to do it and offer to cut it the next day if I'm still unhappy. I find that absolutely unacceptable. On top of the backtalk, they usually do a lazy job of shortening it after I've looked in the mirror and asked for some more off the top, so I end up with uneven hair. 

After taking a long break due to this poor service, I finally came back with a friend last week. We both experienced the same issue all over again with different barbers! They took a quarter inch off then acted huffy when we asked for more. I'll be taking my business elsewhere from now on.",1,1
"about 10 of us. They made room for us.. very nice staff and the drinks were good. 

Everyone at the table had something different and I had a salad with some protein.. everyone was envious as the presentation and healthy benefits my entree had over there's was perfect. 

A pretty extensive menu but everything was so good and so worth the price we paid. We'll be back .",4,5
How can it not be a 5?  Old School Classic Italian done flawlessly. Service was exceptional.,5,5
"Screw going to the Rocky Statue, if you want the true ""Philadelphia"" experience, go to Federal Donuts on a weekend around 11:30 and happily wait for your number to be called to order fried chicken so good, it would make Ben Franklin blush. 

I have never been in such a good mood waiting for my food to be prepared. Mind you, helping yourself to a hot donut while you wait for fried heaven helps the situation. But honestly, the wait is quite reasonable, especially for the happiness that your taste buds are about to experience. 

I ordered two half orders of za'atar and coconut curry and split them with my boyfriend. Although both were fantastic, we both agreed that the coconut curry oh so slightly edged out the za'atar. I've been told though that harissa is the end all and be all of fried chicken. (Unfortunately, they didn't have any that day. Sad face)

I've been here before for donuts only and I know people rave about the fancy donuts, but I think the fresh hot donuts are the way to go. I have never had such crave-worthy donuts in my life.

As a side note, I walked my bag of fried chicken a good mile and a half before I got to dig in, and it was still one of the most splendid things I've ever eaten. Oh, and the honey donut that comes with it was delicious as well.",5,5
Fair pricing. Works quickly and will normally have your phone finished within the hour at the latest,3,5
"I used to really like August Moon. It was close to the house and always very quick. Unfortunately a few months ago, I found a large winged insect suspended in my sweet and sour sauce. After letting the disgust subside over the last few months, we decided to give August Moon another try. Luckily no bugs this time, however there was a large piece of latex glove imbedded in my General Taos. It's safe to say I will be giving up August Moon for good because I am not a big fan of the little extras that have been including in my food. I'd rather make the drive to 5 Hap",1,1
"The Residence Inn on 309 is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in and is a step above the standard Residence Inn. 

The rooms are very large and well appointed. The rooms are always kept exceptionally clean. The staff is as friendly and helpful as I've experienced in my travels. The breakfast buffet is better than you'll find at other hotels. The only times I've had better hotel breakfasts was when the hotel complimentary breakfast was in an attached full service restaurant. 

If you're looking for a hotel in Montgomeryville definitely go for the Residence Inn.",4,5
"Prep Time:  quick
Prices:  affordable prices. I picked up a ""simple pie"" for less than $6. 
Service: Pretty good! We went pretty late in the evening and there weren't many other patrons. It was easy to grab a seat and the owner was pretty attentive.",4,4
"This is my favorite restaurant in Philly. Everything on the menu is so delicious, fresh, and unique. 

My favorite dishes include the black garlic wings, the miso ramen, the fat noodles (just a note: you can't get this dish for take-out only), and coconut curry noodles (which are vegetarian-friendly. Also get a soy marinated egg to go with it!).

Last time my boyfriend and I went, we ordered the sweet and sour Brussels sprouts. I was tentative to get a dish of just Brussels sprouts, but it was amazing! So much flavor and texture. 

If you like delicious Asian fusion, definitely go here!",5,5
"The lobster mac-n-cheese was unforgettable.
I savored every bite. 

Great for fine-dining lunch or brunch. 
Old school service and old school flavor. 
If you want a safe bet, hit Mr. B's.
Plus they are open for lunch with no wait like all the other places we tried.",5,5
It's super oily! And also the entire place smells bad. The service is good though. I don't recommend t be honest,1,2
"We came here on Valentine's Day since we seen the 5 stars on yelp, but saddly me and my husband were disappointed.. It was ok, but not 5 star worthy which is the reason why I went there. The fish didnt taste so fresh, alot of avocado in all 3 rolls, I'm just going to say that my craving wasn't satisfied. And the calamari were overly breaded stringy which was weird and most likely probably pre packaged and not made fresh which sucks because it's a sushi house. But the crab rangoon was delicious it was the first item brought to the table. I was kind of excited about the rest then it started going downhill. Like I said its not a bad restaurant it's just not fulfilling, may be on that side of town its popular. I like going too many restaurants in the Tampa area and I can say that I found a better sushi places.",3,3
"I love dealing with Dr. Meister and Radnor Veterinary Hospital! I see a tremendous dedication on everyone's part to working as a team and providing a superior level of attention to detail re: meeting the medical needs of my senior cat, Nala. I honestly would not go to anyone except Dr. Meister because I know that any feedback will not be thorough enough for me to trust about her condition. Dr. Meister has such a highly-developed interest in cats that he approaches illnesses in ways that go far beyond what other vets pay attention to or are willing to invest. He puts tremendous effort into considering new treatments and alternative approaches when existing meds are not working. In my opinion, this thorough personal dedication to his animal patients is what distinguishes Dr. Meister from the other veterinarians I have seen in the past. I can only guess that the Radnor Vet team's dedication and attention to clients and their pets has grown out of the passion they see coming from the doctors and practice manager(s).",5,5
They charged me a cover a cover to get into this terrible place...that alone gets you 2 stars,2,2
"I had a really good time at the restaurant. It is the first time I have been to Missouri and people have been very friendly with me so far. The service at the restaurant was delightful and the food was on point. If you are looking for good sea food, I would strongly recommend this place. The only bad thing is that if you do not have reservation, it could take some time until you are received. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely come back.",4,5
Great Place!! Awesome and affordable sushi!!!! So fresh!! The staff here are incredible. They love what they do and are experts at it. We love the outdoor seating as well. We felt very welcomed and cared for.  We like grabbing lunch together as a family after church on Sunday and NT is now a new favorite for us in 86th St and Michigan area.  We'll be back for sure.,5,5
"While visiting New Orleans I decided to eat at Luke's for my birthday dinner with my friends. We had the P&J stuffed oysters, the shrimp etouffée and the entrecôte grillée et frites was beyond delicious. I will definitely come back on my next visit to New Orleans.",5,5
"So i have ordered from this restaurant 4 times now.  The first time had a terrible time with the delivery side of the order, but food was good.  The other 3 times i had nothing but cancelled orders and lies about when the food was completed and had left wit the driver.

This happened again last night which was the 4th time!The food was ready within a fair amount of time. So the food is left with the driver 15 minutes late if you're still at the same location on the GPS map. I called the driver after texting and getting no response. He answered and told me after thinking about it for a couple seconds that his car needed a jump. He 10 more minutes. So I gave him 10 more minutes and of course nothing happens, the car never left GPS location where it was at the restaurant.

I cancelled order.",2,1
"If you live in St. Louis and you haven't been here, what is wrong with you?! I LOVE Crown Candy. One of my favorites. It's totally about the experience for me. And I just can't even describe how much I enjoy a good chocolate malt and a turkey sandwich. Mainly come for the malt though. Heavenly. Everyone rants and raves about the BLT. Maybe if I liked bacon I would be too... Haha but I just don't! I know, I know, how Un-American of me. 

I also enjoy coming because my grandparents went on dates here before they were married 60 years ago! It just makes me smile being at Crown Candy.",5,5
The chicken and fries dish was the best I have ever had. It has been over a year since I ate here and I still talk about it. I can't wait to go back!,5,5
"Yet to have a flavor I didn't like, but Cafe au Lait, Black & Gold Crunch and the Earl Grey are excellent.",5,5
"We have enjoyed the food here--eat in and take out. I recently had one of the best chicken quesadillas I have ever had--maybe even better than the ones I make at home! The server situation is another story. This week we had a fantastic waitress and we were there at an ""off"" hour so the place wasn't busy. Some of them have been very bad. Either they need customer service training or they have too many tables and they get busy, rushed and stressed.",4,4
My review is not for the hotel itself but for the valet parking garage. Went to have dinner across the street and used the garage. When we went to pick up our car it was brought out quick which is great. However I noticed the guy driving went to turn off the car and was having a hard time taking the key out of the ignition. He then seemed to try and start the car again but nothing. He then gets out of the car and walks off. We honestly didn't think much of it at first until my husband tired to turn the car on and it wouldn't start. Then realized it wouldn't start because the car wasn't in park. One would think being a valet driver you would know you place the vehicle in park before turning it off.  What bothers me most is the guy didn't even bother to say anything just gets out and walks away. I was for a moment feeling bad for not tipping him but glad I didn't. We did not say anything before leaving since there were other cars behind us waiting to get out and we were ready to head out ourselves.,1,1
"This is pretty much our work happy hour spot since it's right across the street, and easily accessible to 30th street station. Missed the train? Stop by Slainte. Have a craving for fries? Stop by Slainte. The place reminds me of a classier Kildare's. At lunch time, you'll find construction workers to business professionals. Beware: can be a lengthy wait during the hours of 11:30 - 1:30 pm.

This place has a pretty decent draft list that changes with the season. And a major plus for me - Mad Elf in the winter time! :)",3,5
Great place for lunch. We had the cheeseburger special with fries and a medium drink. Hamburger was cooked to perfection. Also we enjoyed the fact that our dog could go in the cafe and lay beside our table. What a great idea. Strongly recommend this for anyone shopping at Cabela's or just passing by.,5,5
"I had the hot sausage po' boy with fries and cole slaw.  Food was great.  Also had a couple of frozen mint juleps which were tasty.  Very boozy but good.  Also tried the bacon fat popcorn which was greasy but delicious.  Did not have any beers, but they did have a pretty extensive beer list.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stop in for a drink or to get dinner.",4,5
"This is hands down a MUST try!  If you are adventurous these dishes here are refreshing and new to the palate.  We took the in laws (who were born in Cambodia) and they said the food was very authentic.

#Wait:  No wait on Tues for lunch at noon.  However their hours were super inconsistent.  States open at 10am but they didn't open until noon.  FYI:  last seating is 1hr before they close.

#Food:   In order of what I would recommend.
- Cha Trop- roasted eggplant with oyster sauce:  A+.  Sauce is creamy and curry like.  Big portions

-Soup- Sah Law Ka Koe with fish  9/10. A+  Deep curry like broth.  Get it with fish for no extra charge

- Cha La Pauh with Pork- pumpkin with pork:   A+.  Pumpkin super soft and combo of spices very unique.  Only negative is that it's kinda oily

-Appetizer:  Cha Mussels B+.  Mussels mildy chewy.  Curry sauce brings it over the top

-Cha Lok Lak with Beef B+.  Beef cubes medium rare not too chewy.  Good to try but would try above first before this.

- Sah Law Machue Kahteeh with Check C-.  Broth is weirdly sour and too salty for me.  I would say skip this one.

#Service:  B- This is a mom/pop place.  The son is only server and parents cook in the back.  They serve ingredients fresh so as a result we waited almost full 45mins before food came out (even though restaurant practically empty).

#Parking: street only

Overall this place really has some simple dishes that hit a home run.  Prices reasonable.  Other than slow service and inconsistent hours we would definitely come back here again and again.  This is a gem of a restaurant in Philly.",5,5
"I went here after reading positive reviews online about them. I was pretty impressed. 

Not sure why I was so nervous walking in here. I had done my research on my first firearm, but I wanted a more hands on approach to the process. 

I dealt with Larry. Although there were people behind me, he handled their business first, stating he wanted to take some time with me and walk me through the process of buying a firearm. He was no nonsense and straight to the point. Walked me through everything and had me in and out in about 30 minutes. He was really awesome to deal with. He even gave me some coupons to return at a later date so he could walk me through the ins and outs of my new weapon and fire at the range. Awesome.

The place is kinda dusty and boxes are everywhere....but that really didnt bother me. I got what I went in for and had a great experience.",4,5
"Daredevil Hall is a small casual eatery located in the Ironworks Hotel building on the southwest corner of Keystone Avenue and 86th Street on the Indianapolis northside. There is significant free off-street parking just south of the building, and while I have heard that parking can sometimes be problematic I have also heard that Daredevil Hall customers can use the hotel's free valet parking if they wish.

Daredevil Brewing Company opened the Hall some three or four months ago, and although I live in the area I only this past week gave it a try. I was not impressed.

The interior is an L-shaped space divided into two primary areas with approximately three dozen stools in the bar area and an assortment of benches and picnic-type tables in the more general dining area. The decor is industrial, and given those acoustics the noise level is loud. A row of garage-type doors/windows make up the south wall of the bar.

The food offerings include a selection of shareable small plates, salads, pommes frites, sandwiches and sausage dogs, and more. There is also a short children's menu. Beverages include an extensive list of ales, beers, ciders, and lagers; a short list of wines; and a typical list of non-alcoholic options.

I chose to sit at the bar. My server was Ryanne, who was quite cordial but not always especially attentive. I ordered the Traditional Poutine from the pommes frites section of the menu, and that's when things really fell apart. When the dish arrived I was first surprised with what I thought to be a somewhat small serving. Then when I really looked at it I saw that food was burned, some of the fries actually going to crunchy charcoal at the ends. The burnt flavor tended to permeate throughout. At that, the portion that was not overpowered by the burnt flavor was not particularly palatable. I'm not enough of a gourmet to pin it down, but I would guess the gravy arrives on site in cans.

With the numerous other options in the immediate area, I will not be going back to Daredevil Hall.",2,2

"An 83 year-old long-time patient of your clinic came in within 24 hours of a car accident for pain. One of your doctors did not refer her to the ER nor do an examination. He handed her a pile of paperwork  and told her to come back in a week and a half. Absolutely ridiculous! I will be filing a complaint with the medical board, and pursuing every legal option available.",1,1
"We were traveling from Atlanta to Chicago and looking for a place to stop for dinner. I yelped and found this place.  We were very satisfied, we were 6 people and everyone enjoyed. The food was very good- a little spicy but tasty. The ambience was also nice & the servers were friendly too. I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to enjoy then stop here !!!",5,5
"First timer. Pleasant atmosphere, moderately priced. Service a bit slow but friendly. Happy hour till 7.  Tasty food.",4,4
"I mourned Balaban's closing to the point that I resolved myself to never walk through Herbie's doors out of respect for what once was.  Good thing I rarely hold true to my resolutions!

Herbie's was excellent.  We sat in the bistro section next to the open windows on a beautiful evening.  The service was wonderful from start to finish even though it was a very busy night.  

BIG props for having a gluten free menu.  It's always great to have a knowledgeable chef when it comes to gluten free but it's a real bonus when they actually print out a G.F. menu that spells everything out for you.

My filet was cooked perfect medium rare.  Spinach could have used a tad more seasoning but that was easily taken care of.  Potatoes had a great garlic taste without being overpowering.  Also had their play on a mint julep--think it was called a Kentucky Sweet.  YUM.  Also had their, I believe it was the house, salad.  Delicious.  Tons of bacon, avocado, and the best ranch dressing I've had in years.

Overall, an excellent way to spend an evening in the Central West End.",4,5
"Reading some of these reviews, we were a little hesitant to come here. I expected aloof staff, inability to find parking, poor wifi and a long wait for food.

Our expectations were not met.  Visit ruined. 

I kid. 

It was actually quite a pleasant visit. We were a little confused about how everything worked, so we didn't know you could sit down and a wait person would bring you menus. We ended up ordering our food at the counter and then sitting down in a booth. It all worked out. We got our food, and the counter guy even came by and checked on us to make sure everything worked out.  My husband got the chicken salad sandwich and I got the burger. Both were fresh, delicious and well presented. 

After our meal, we got coffee drinks (sweet ginger chai and cinnamon iced coffee). These were also delicious and well made. 

We parked a bit away on the street. We didn't have to pay for parking. There was some construction in the building, but it didn't affect the quality of the food or coffee. I only mention it because I saw it on my way to the bathroom.

I've been in some pretty pretentious coffee shops. This isn't one of them. All in all, a very enjoyable place to spend a few hours.",4,5
"Dear STL,

You have NO IDEA how good you have it when it comes to great beer. You have this genius, this beer guru, just casually setting up shop in your backyard. Beer genius, ain't no thang. 

The owner at Perennial is doing great things. He's doing ballsy things. Like AC/DC ""Big Balls"" things. One new beer, every week, 52 weeks a year, Thursday at 6pm. That's NUTS. 

STL. You are spoiled and you don't even know it. 

The owner cites Jolly Pumpkin as the ballsiest brewer in the country. He's right. They use some sort of crazy wild yeast, brew some hella funky but unique and respected beers... But what he's doing? That takes a whole lot of hutzpah. 

These beers are clever. They are typically a tip of the hat to the great beer country of Belgium, but meant to be lighter. Trust me, I was initially disappointed at the less than 9.0% ABV tap list... but I got over it. I understood it, appreciated it even, that I could have more than 3 beers and not be wrecked. They are different. Appreciate that they are different. This will be the Jolly Pumpkin of STL, maybe even better. 

However, the waitstaff / bartenders ... need some retraining. They cannot handle a full bar seamlessly. There are severe service glitches as the place gets busier. 

Redeeming plus to the inconsistent service? They have some ridiculously sexy cheeses on their cheese board. Amazing cheese with delightfully different yet familiar beers trumps sketchy service any day of the week. 

I beg of you, Saint Louis, love and cherish this place. It is truly one of the best things you have in your city. 

Sincerely,
Chicagoan corrupted and spoiled by Michigan microbrews transplanted in a beer desert known as Houston, TX

PS - if you don't want him, I think Houston could benefit!!!",5,5
"Clean hotel, friendly staff, superb location, lovely amenties.

I was so impressed with my stay here. Check in was a breeze. My room was clean, comfortable and had everything i needed except an oven: but who wants that on a staycation.

I stayed in the sterling suite for almost a week, and the weekdays were more expensive than the weekend rates. The atmosphere here is business casual, lots of government employees and business cliente. Absolutly no children in sight. 

The room was modern and sleek, my issues were the dim lighting. Even the desk was poorly lit but during the day, the wall to wall window views of dt kept the room bright. I was surprised that my room had a fridge, sink, microwave and complete wet bar. Our living room even had a nice sofabed. Came with slippers for 2 and complimentary voss water daily. 

Housekeeping was great, except for 1 day they skipped our room for no apparent reason. I loved the fragrant soaps and shampoos here. 

The best part of our stay was the daily buffet breakfast and the wine tasting with cheese. I loved it. It was perfect pre dinner appetizers since it was from 530-630. The automatic latte/cappacino machine was awesome! I loved it.",4,5
"Some of the tastiest Southern fried chicken! I had the spicy, dark meat and it was fantastic. The chicken itself was juicy, the flavor of the brine really soaking in even after it was fried. The only down part was that the skin wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it. Unfortunately, it was chewy instead. The mac and cheese was phenomenal! A must have. The broccoli was also really great. I'd come back to try out their fried catfish.",4,4
"This KOA was one of our favorites on our 2 month long road trip. It's a big campground so the main office and our spot was pretty far away. Thankfully, they have two areas-one in the front and one in the back. They even have two clean and warm pools. The site itself is super easy to get into with all the hookups we needed. They have a table and some chairs set out with a tree nearby for shade. The lime tree was so pretty and smelled great. The people were quick, thorough, and super nice! I would recommend if you are staying in the area.",5,5
"Oh Superior Grill, everyone has heard of it. Whether good or bad, good if you are a tourist and bad if you are a local.  Well I moved to New Orleans 4 months ago and finally decided to go for my birthday dinner, I DONT know what I was thinking, Superior Grill is the WORST Tex-mex place I have ever been too. The margarita came out in a foam Togo cup and tasted like something I could get out of a can, because it probably was... The fish tacos were a disappointment to say the least. This place was not only a waste of my money, but more importantly a waste of my time.",1,1
"I was looking for a new road bike to replace my 15-year old Trek and wanted to look at lighter and slightly softer bikes as I age and seek comfort. It was happenstance that I ended up at Fair Wheel Bikes, but I couldn't be happier. I visited several road bike stores in my quest to find the perfect fitting bike. This store demonstrated amazing customer service for several hours each of the 3 times I visited to test and retest bikes. This meant changing tires, handlebars, seats, etc. Paul was very knowledgeable and anticipated my needs. Steve made some changes to encourage the best fit. Their inventory is the best I've seen in Tucson. I purchased a Trek Emonda SL6 from them and a number of accessories that also needed replacement. And then if service couldn't get better, my own cycling shoes had an issue with a cleat. They tried fixing it, and ended up making a call to Shimano. Turns out the shoes were warranted, and I get a new pair of shoes! Thank you for such a wonderful experience. I highly recommend trying this store for your biking needs.",5,5
"Fantastic bakery with the best rolls and my favorite Italian cookies! I also recently started going here for their deli sandwiches and they are delicious, they definitely won't disappoint (again because of the great bread). If you haven't been here I would highly recommend going.",5,5
We came here for breakfast.  The food was pretty good.  Their feta dip and wrapped dates were really good.  The peanut butter waffle was fun to eat but I wish they had more sweet breakfast items to choose from.  All and all though it was a pretty good brunch experience.,4,4
"I give them 4 stars.  Comfy beds, safe entry well lit. The hotel is right off canal and walking distance to everything. I was upset because they did not do a good job at advertising the parking fee, $38. I felt it was un-necessary. The valet manager Mark G. He needs a promotion. I was upset, and no matter what things I said, he would not let it affect his positive attitude. He was a champion of customer service. I think he truly understands the travel industry and is in the right field. Was very friendly and handled the situation with professionalism and grace actually made me laugh. The entire valet staff were friendly, fast, and I feel they all deserve a raise. I spoke to the actual manager of the hotel about my concerns and hoping to get the parking fee waived, but he IMO is not a people person. The actual manager of the hotel doesn't really seem like he likes his job.They could use a person like Mark in that position. Any way I was going to call corporate but Mark did explain this is just how it is in the French Quarter. He says no other hotel or parking spot would be cheaper and he was right. I walked about 6 miles and their price was the least expensive.
Overall, tbh I actually do not care for the Wyndham brand. Too many of the ones I have stayed in were not up to par. However, I would come back here. I actually, saw Mark the next day and we laughed about how horrible I was.  
Just beware all the hotels and parking will be expensive here.",4,4
The King Corner Spa room is LIVING!!! Only thing missing is a coffee maker and could of used extra shampoo/conditioner which were fantastic.,4,5
"We opted to buy tickets for the 5pm show. We knew that after a full day of sightseeing standing in line for an hour and another hour for the show didn't sound appealing. We arrived around 4:45 and waited in the big shot line.  The general admission line was already pretty long by that time.  Very organized venue. The prepaid seating is assigned so you will sit where they have you down.  G A is seating on the floor or standing in the back.  It's a very small room.  The band was really good as were the acoustics. 
Definitely catch a show if you can.",5,4
"Freakishly Amazing! The Amsterdam is a Grilled Peanut Butter and Gouda Cheese Sandwich with Raspberry Dressing for dipping (or so I thought, and so I did). There was good chunky crunch to the peanut better, and I am usually not a fan of crunchy, but MAN-O-MAN was it GOOD! It came with some apples and sun dried cranberries on the side. Perfect lunch! 

On lunch break I got a traffic ticket. It was terrible. But then I made it to Bricks of Ybor and this great place made it all better. This sandwich was awesome. Sat at the bar, sipped a small Carlsburg Pilsner, and caught up with a friend. Told stories and had a great time.

Service was not super fast, but fast enough and more importantly, friendly. Restaurant was busy but not super crowded. 

My buddy ask the bartender what was good. She said close your eyes and point. He got a ceasar wrap. I might be wrong. He was happy with it, but I don't think as happy as I was with my food. As I said above, I was not happy...like James Brown the SUPER FREAK - I WAS FREAKISHLY AMAZED. Can you believe this was my first time. I loved the Amsterdam so much that I will have a hard time not getting it when I go back to the Bricks of Ybor!",5,5
"Items Selected:
Cornmeal Pancakes with Honey
Swedish Pancakes with Lingonberry
Banana Bread Pancakes with Cinnmon Cream Sauce
Half Order French Toast
Coffee

Arriving in Nashville the night before I almost couldn't wait to finally visit a restaurant my breakfast-loving self had long heard was amongst the best in the region, and opting to avoid rumors of long lines with an early Tuesday arrival our party of three walked right into the Pancake Pantry, a cozy table at the center of a large dining room ours for as long we'd want it, a relatively slow morning never once seeing the space more than half filled.

Celebrating ""50 years & still 23 varieties"" in reference to their eponymous griddled specialty it was with water filled and menus in hand that menus were perused and quickly poured the type of atrociously over-roasted coffee that makes it clear why some people absolutely hate the stuff it was thankfully that the kitchen was not overburdened, a trio of pancakes soon arriving alongside half an order of French Toast.

Unfortunately not offering 100% Maple Syrup, but instead featuring house-made Cinnamon Cream Sauce and some sort of artificial rubbish overly sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup, it was with the French Toast that the tasting began and featuring eggy cinnamon bread not quite soaked to the core the flavor was perfectly fine, though certainly nothing worth writing home about, a slather of butter and cinnamon cream adding a bit more flavor both here and to 'banana bread' pancakes that were oblong and lightly tinged in both fruit and nuts without being too sweet or aromatic at all.

Perhaps making a mistake in eschewing classic buttermilk or signature sweet potato flapjacks it was onward to thin Swedish pancakes that the tasting progressed and although already cool to touch by the time they arrived the flavor of both the light batter and lingonberries were quite pleasant, the far more toothsome cornmeal cakes dressed up in honey proving to be the best bites of the breakfast largely due to the lightly bronzed and buttery exterior, plus the fact that everything else was just so mediocre.",2,3
"We went to Dairy Queen tonight! Very excited because it is national ice cream day and after waiting in line. Had to bend down to tell the cashier what we wanted. Ordered the new royal Oreo blizzard, the ultimate chocolate blizzard and Reese peanut butter cup blizzard. After asking for lids, we left. All of them melted and leaked on the five minute drive home and got all over the inside of cup holders. Once we started drinking them because they were so melted I learned mine was not the one I ordered with fudge in the middle, it was just a regular Oreo blizzard and the ultimate chocolate blizzard had a little dot of fudge at the bottom and the Reese peanut butter cup was the one that melted the most all over the car so we haven't eaten that one we put it in the freezer to get back to solid state.. also, the workers never once flipped the ice cream over before handing it to us, presumably because it would have ended up all over the floor. Most definitely a bad experience, unacceptable!",2,1
"I Should have taken a picture but I never realized that was a thing I could post, cold food and completely inedible Crunchwrap.",1,1

"First excellent and informative staff. Whether it Jeff, Mollie, Aaron, Kelsey or a host of other trainers/coaches here you'll likely land in a class with someone who is well versed in the ins and outs of crossfit training. The atmosphere is light but at the same time very competitive which is why I chose this gym over some of the others in the city. Whenever I would do a ride by they were ALWAYS working hard, and being the type of person who feels most comfortable in that environment I gravitated to it. 

The pace and competitiveness is always accompanied by a positive an encouraging comradery, so anyone even someone who has never worked out or played sports before could come in and not feel intimidated at all. If I had to guess I would guess I would say the ratio is about 2 to 1 men but many of the women are as impressive or moreso than some of the guys. 

I would recommend the Burthe street location to anyone though I've heard the midcity locale as the same feel and is a bit larger. In all great place to get a workout.",5,5
"This one definitely gets a value 4-star. The food isn't particularly amazing... you aren't getting some transcending food experience. But you're getting an awesome bang-for-your-buck experience. Staff is always nice and super helpful. Always willing to go out of their way. Parking is usually fine, there's a parking lot next door with some extra parking as well as across the street. They are expanding though, so I don't know how that'll change this.
Check-in on yelp and get free queso, and leave here paying around $15pp. Tortas are good sandwiches, flautas are good (sometimes over cooked though), tacos are okay, fajitas are a go-to, enchiladas are very good, taco pirata is a giant quesadilla, and skip the tostadas (they're impossible to eat).
As I said, not fantastic. But a great go-to in place of going to an affordable chain like an outback or Olive Garden.",4,4

I did not see that many people smoking. I guess they do not clean or filter the air.
So tobacco smoke spit out of the black lungs of an addict makes you want to sit and fill a machine with your money for hours???
I can think of a million better things to do with my money and time and life.",1,1
"Updating my review as I had another STELLAR experience with DON LOWRY at Toyota of Santa Barbara.  That Don is a real straight shooter.  I was so impressed by my lover's Prius C and the amazing experience we had with Don working with him before.. 2 months later my own car was circling the drain...  I didn't even bother with looking at inventory closer to me, I contacted Don directly and he responded promptly and thoroughly to my inquiry - NO BS, NO Haggling, NO pushing anything I didn't want.  He happened to have exactly what I was looking for.  It was well worth the 100 mile drive - so I made the trek again to Toyota of Santa Barbara.  When I got there, the car was ready for me and Don showed me all these neat features of the car - he's the ultimate product expert.  The process was so swift... no surprises in the cost or the offer, easy insurance hookup while in the office late on Sunday, the process with fiance was quick and easy to understand. I know it sounds crazy to drive 100 miles and spend 2 hours in traffic each way to get to this dealership, but I'm telling you, the difference in the work ethic, not to mention unbelievable pricing the dealer offers is absolutely worth it.  I only want to buy cars from Don!",5,5
This chicken was some of the best I had while in NOLA. On a late night or anytime you want a little snack this place fulfills your needs. Not only do they have good chicken but the frozen daiquiri machine drinks are great too. There are several tasty flavors that they let you mix & match & you can get it in a cute little container to keep. The fries are just ok & greasy but perfect after a night of partying. The chicken is very well seasoned & I didn't even need sauce for my chicken fingers. I'll definitely come again.,5,5
I was in need of an emergency filling repair. The door was open and I walked in and while I was shopping a man came up and asked me if I was a vendor.  He told me  I had to leave because their computers are broken I offered to give him enough cash to pay for it and he can ring it in later just so I can get this and he said nope they're not allowed to do anything by hand. Unacceptable.,1,1
This place has always been so good!  I've always gone here since I was little and it is pricey but you get what you pay for and the flavor is just undeniably good!,4,5
"The other night I took my mother to eat for her Birthday.  The food was delicious, the beer was not the best but pretty good.  It was the worst service that I have ever had.  This was the first time I visited the Voorhees restaurant for dinner and I don't believe I will be coming back.  I have been to the Maple Shade, Chestnut Hill, and Media location on many occasions and I have come to expect a certain level of service.  There were a few little inconveniences that we experienced, I am a mug club member, showed my card and didn't receive the mug of beer and even after ordering it took over 15 minutes to receive the beer.  But the kicker was 20 minutes after placing the order our server came by and told my mother that they ran out of the tuna and she would need to order something else.  At this point we had already been sitting for 45 minutes.  I wasn't going to ask for something to be comped, but I feel that the server should have suggested something, an appetizer or dessert, but nothing.  We were hungry by that point and it isn't her fault that the food wasn't available but she should have offered us something while we waited for our food to be prepared.",2,2
"Cozy atmosphere and a very welcoming spot. Wonderful staff, amazing setting, and the food is absolutely amazing. Drink a latte or a glass of wine!",5,5
"I really don't understand all these bad reviews for Alta! At first I had a little trouble getting in, but explained that I'd broken my leg over the weekend and may require surgery, so should get in sooner than later. I was squeezed in within the hour and received appropriate time and attention. Dr. Harrison is a little reserved but pleasant and knowlegable, answering every question I had. The front office has worked to accomodate my schedule and has always been helpful - every one of them. I've had no trouble with anyone there, whatsoever.",5,5
No show for appointment today. Sure indication of things to come so won't call them again!,1,1
"I come here pretty often for drinks and food with friends. Nice atmosphere, attentive staff (super important to me) and live music too. I definitely recommend it as somewhere to eat and hang out.",5,5
"Nice hotel, but the valet parking is horrible.  TWICE I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my car - no one could find the keys!  And I had to pay $40 for that experience.  I could have saved a ton of time with the self-park option .... and saved $8 too!

The hotel is very nice and clean, and there are lots of dining options.  HOWEVER, they do seem to be hell-bent on overcharging their guests whenever they can.  I expect to pay a premium for on-property dining and drinks, but the hotel and its vendors take this to an entirely new level.  $7 for a Cinnabon?  $13 for a stack burger combo?  $4 for a chap-stick?  I rarely complain about these sorts of things, but this isn't a 5 star resort where I expect those sorts of charges.

Bottom line - don't use valet parking, and go off property for dinner!",3,3
"It seems like most reviews take points away for the location.  For me and my friends that was a huge positive.  I love how it's hidden inside a furniture warehouse.  I think it adds to the thrill of going there.  It's like a speakeasy.  Food is great, and I even went with a friend who is a French chef, who agreed that the food is good.",5,5
"I will give credit where credit is due. The owner was so nice on the phone and answered all of my questions in details about how they groom the dogs and if they put them in crates or not. The two ladies were very nice when I dropped off my dogs, I went over what I wanted with the groomer and quickly they were done. My long haired dog had a botched haircut. 
1. The groomer claimed there was a mat on the end of the tail (I know there wasn't because I brushed her before the appointment) and chopped off chunks (uneven) of her beautiful tail. You would think she would even it out. 2. She was shaved SO short, I asked for half of her hair to stay but she took off WAY more than half. And the shaving is uneven and looks really bad. 
3. She has razored in areas behind her ears and looks like she coughed while cutting or shaving or whatever she was doing. 
4. I asked they to keep my dogs together while they were being groomed due to their anxiety and they said yes, but I come to find out that one do was waiting up stairs while the other was getting done and having a lot of anxiety the whole time. 

They gave me 30$ back out of 130$ and I am still so upset about this. At least my dogs were not physically hurt in anyway, emotionally though, they were.",1,2
"For those with even a slightly educated palate of real Italian food, stay away. Beware as items are not as described on the menu. Salad was soggy and the blue cheese dressing was more like a bottle ranch with minuscule, almost tasteless amounts of blue cheese. Someone should tell the chef that flat peeled strips of carrots are not ""julienne"". Tomatoes were not ripe. Description on menu for scallops I ordered.  ""Capesante al Brandy: sautéed jumbo sea scallops in a light lobster cream sauce"" NOT! Scallops were almost inedible as they were drowned in a very salty red sauce with no trace of lobster. Big disappointment for my birthday dinner. Would have sent everything back if I was not taken out. Would never go there again. I could not believe this place was crowded...then I found out they were all using groupons! So sad that my dad paid full price for this sad excuse of a meal.",1,1
"The food and drinks are fantastic but the service/kitchen could use a little improvement. On multiple occasions we have waited a LONG time for drinks and appetizers. When these were finally delivered, we got our cocktails, our appetizers and our main courses all at once. This makes for an unpleasant wait followed by a rush of too much food that you can't really enjoy before it all gets cold.",2,3
"I think this place is pretty new, and Ive never actually set foot inside, but I checked out the website and everything looked beautiful and delicious. 

They accept online orders so I ordered a bunch of holiday petit fours for the nurses, doctors and staff at Touro. Another plus was that they delivered to the hospital for free!

They gobbled those suckers down and everyone had nothing but praise. I cant wait to check out the actual shop and gorge.",5,5
"We had such a disappointing experience here last week (6/16). I had been once before and had a great time, so I brought my sons with me, thinking they would enjoy the menu. Both service and food were underwhelming. We couldn't even drink away our disappointment, since once the food FINALLY arrived, our server never came back to ask if we needed anything. We were thirsty, frustrated, and underwhelmed. We ordered appetizers (these came promptly and were freshly plated and hot), a range of small plates and an entree. The waitress asked us if we wanted them all at the same time and we said we did so that one person wasn't eating alone. I think she might have forgotten to tell the kitchen this, though. After a LONG wait, again with no one thinking to tell us that our order was coming or asking us if we would like more drinks, our dried out, cold meals arrived. Cold poutine with bad French fries is completely unacceptable. Even the baked beans that came with the rib dinner were dried out. My sons are athletes in their early 20s and are always hungry. Even they didn't want to eat the food. I can't remember the last time I ate somewhere that cared less about my experience. You can do a lot better in Mt. Airy. Go up the street to Earth Bread & Brewery. I wish we had.",1,1
Been here many times and my order is messed up every time. Tried giving them the benefitt of the doubt but I think its just ineptitude. Poor or nonexistant manners as well.,1,1
"This studio rocks! The instructors (I took class from Mel and Sarah) are attentive and knowledgeable. I loved taking aerial fitness class, I work out a lot, but working on the hammock was a new kind of burn. The facility is peaceful and well-appointed. I highly recommend!",5,5
Highly attentive service without being over barring. I enjoy going back to sit at the bar and have an appetizer and drink. Great value.,4,5
"I made an appointment online the day before my vacation for service to the airport in the morning. After a few hours there was no confirmation email or call, so I called them to confirm that a car was indeed going to pick me up in the morning. 

The guy that answered the phone didn't even ask my name, reservation details....nothing. He just said that yes, they would be there and basically hung up. 

So next morning comes, all bags are packed and ready to go and....you guessed it, no cab. We waited as long as possible and finally had to pack our car and go. At $15 cab fare turned into $115 long term parking fee.

Absolutely avoid this company at all costs. Worst customer service I've experienced in a long while. If I wasn't so nice, I would send them the bill for parking.",1,1
"A must stop for your trip to NOLA. The king's cake french toast was ultimately the reason to stop- and it was worth every bite. A dish that is aesthetically pleasing + taste great is always amazing. Definitely recommend the yelp waitlist button, this place sees high volume and is a little small to accommodate that. Wasn't overly impressed with the service but overall this place was great.",4,5
"Saw so many raves for the shrimp and grits that I stopped by a couple of days ago for that. I have to say, maybe it's just not for me. It was drenched in this vinaigrette that made the whole plate overly acidic. The Bacon Bloody Mary (yes bacon) however, has given me a new fondness for the drink. The staff was friendly and hospitable. There was no wait time for a table. The menu looked good, I'll come back and try something else more breakfast like.",3,4
Love this place! They have the most awesome fresh ravs. I have unfortunately eaten an entire dozen in an evening. Yep a whole dozen. I have had the frozen lobster raviolis which are good too but nothing beats a fresh cheese ravioli. I haven't had the meat ones yet or the cavatelli. They have several different ones on the menu. They have a few different sauces also. The Alfredo is OK. I'm a little picky about my sauce since I love to make my own.,5,5
"Hidden Treasure! 

I have been lost since Teavanna closed searching for a tea store that had teas comparable to those I had grown to love from there. I was in KoP Mall today and searched tea stores near me.  While heading to a different store that came up in my search, I happened upon Tranquilitea Temple and so glad that I did. The gentleman that helped me, Colin, actually worked for Teavanna so was very familiar with my favorites from there and was able to point me to both exact and comparable teas in his store. I was able to smell the aromas of each and my happiness grew with each inhale.  And to top it off, they were all priced less. 

I stocked up on each of my 3 favorites and am home now sipping my cup of Earl Grey Cream so happy about my find. Even though I live in NJ, I will for sure be back and may even venture outside of my comfort zone and explore something new. There were so many options and Colin seemed as though he knew details about them all.

Really worth the trip for tea lovers or someone interested in giving tea a chance. With so many options they for sure have something you will love or something that will assist with your goals, whether it be for stress relief, health or just something that tastes delicious.",5,5
"This was a nice hotel. It was across the street from the beach which made it slightly cheaper. The room was clean. It would have been nice if they offered chairs for the beach. In addition, it is narrow and has only one set of elevators. The hallways are very hot and there are no activities for the kids. The view from the room was nice but of the side of the bay. The breakfast was just ok. The eggs and sausage weren't good and they didn't have non dairy options such as almond or soy milk for the cereal.",3,3
"Good sandwiches -- I kinda didn't know what to expect, but then the smoked turkey pesto caprese sandwich was really tasty! All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Don't just get the already-made ones, order them at the counter to be made right then.",4,4
"I have visited the HandleBar at least twice and each time has been for a birthday party. Both times the service has been decent and the drinks have been great. I like how they have craft beers on tap and I like how the bartenders (even though they are slammed with business) provide me with information about the beers so I know what the expect. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool if you are into bikes. Some really cool architecture and decorations throughout the entire place, including the patio. 

I definitely know I am old though because one the DJ starts playing I am usually ready to go! The music is loud and I don't fell like dancing when I am drinking my craft beer (I don't want to spill it)!

Overall, I do enjoy the HandleBar, but I don't know if this would be a top pick for a location I would choose on my own.",4,4
"Easy parking. Short quick moving line. Very friendly staff. A couple  of options for breakfast, gluten and dairy free. They could use more gluten free baked goods that are gluten free.
Seats are very hard and uncomfortable, especially for those with sciatica issues.
No loud music , relaxing. Outdoor patio option is very pleasant. Only 2 bathrooms for a lot of seating , they could use one more bathroom and not 1 ply tissue since the food and drinks are not cheap.",5,3
"The crowd was very lively and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves. There is a cover charge of $10 on the weekends. The drinks seemed watered down but were competitively priced ($8-$12 per drink). 

Very fun bar, would definitely return but would pregame elsewhere!",4,4
"Best quality seafood market around, and you MUST try their takeout food! Made to order,  fresh and so delicious. (Best fish n chips I've ever had, wow)",5,5
The food here is always fresh and the wait staff is very friendly. No pressure and easy going atmosphere. I have only eaten breakfast here so my rating is based on that. The eggs appear to be fresh and the ingredients are good. The omelette are stuffed with ingredients. Give this place a try,4,5
I thought Sbraga was great!  Amazingly varied menu with a great prix fixe cost.  I really enjoyed my meal at Sbraga.,4,5
"What a wonderful museum!  Not only is the building beautiful, but the exhibits are fabulous.  It's a great way to learn more about the history of our country through the eyes of the artists.
There's a parking garage on the property and the parking is free for museum visitors.  
I highly recommend a visit.",4,5
Awesome customer service and experience.  My technician was Tammy and she ensured that all my nails were great and that the color shape and size  was just right. She also was able to do my replacement and match the others just so.,5,5
"I have lived in Nashville for 5 years now, and been searching for my new nail spot in this city & I finally found it! I feel like I have been to every nail shop in the city at this point & Comfy Nails is by far the best. After having multiple people mention Comfy Nails to me within a week, I had to see for myself and they were absolutely right! Comfy Nails has a great convenient location, the shop is clean and well decorated, and they have all the colors and services you could hope for. Everyone there does an amazing job! For everyone's convenience, make an appointment. The amazing staff at Comfy Nails will take great care of you! :)",5,5
"Amazing food!
We created our own pizza - I suggest roasted garlic, crawfish, oysters and spinach.
It was delicious!!!!
Def worth the $9 Uber ride to get here!

Great vanilla lattes and the chocolate chip pumpkin muffin was amazing as well. Great service too!,5,5
"Taco Bell is Taco Bell, I don't expect gourmet food here.  But every single time we come to this location they forget to give us part of our order.  Not sure what the issue is.  The service through the drive at this location is really friendly and polite.  I just wish I didn't have to thoroughly check my order before leaving.",2,3
"Kahwa coffee, local beer, good wine list and outstanding desserts.....owned by lovely people.
We had lattes and split the banana cream pie in a glass which was delish. Then we took home goodies. I enjoyed the coconut cake for Valentine's dinner at home. 
Wi-fi and electrical outlets for you to work and charge up (you and your computer).
Will be back, especially for happy hour 3-6.",5,5
"I came home after being away for a week to find all the external locks for my apartment building  and lock to my suite changed while I was gone. I found out they'd changed the locks with 2 days' notice and slid new keys under everyone's doors. I was beside myself as it was late, I had my dog with me, and I just wanted to get into my apartment. When I got ahold of the building manager, I asked why they hadn't called or emailed residents of the building as not being able to access my apartment was a huge shock and inconvenience. I didn't get an answer. I have never experienced this level of inconsiderate, neglectful service from any company, retail outlet, or business. It seems like a cruel joke but it's real-life incompetence.",1,1
"The environment was so much fun, the staff was super friendly and the food was delicious. I can't wait to go back when it's not crazy with CMAFest people.",5,5
"Excellent barbecue - hot sauce is the bomb. Very friendly and fast service!  Had the Dale's sandwich (pork topped with sausage) and a side of slaw and Mac n cheese. Be careful, you'll slap ya mama!!!!!!!",5,5
"I am quite disappointed with my experience on the Carnival Paradise this past week.
The wait staff never seemed pleasant with me or even made eye contact with my party. They were quite rude with one of the first waiter's responses being, ""What do you want."" I was really thrown for a loop after sailing with Carnival before and never had I experienced such an attitude.
The waiter then incorrectly charged me for a surf and turf that I never ordered.

I went to Guest Services twice throughout my cruise and both times they were unapologetic and reluctant to resolve the issue. They said they had to confirm with dining whether I was telling the truth about my order instead of taking care of it right then and there. I ended up having to go into the restaurant and talk to a manager myself to get it finally taken care of. Never heard another response from Guest Services, so they easily forgot about my issue twice.

We ended up not attending dinners for the rest of cruise worrying that we would get overcharged again and that it wouldn't be taken care of. The atmosphere and attitude at the dining really bummed my boyfriend and I. It really embarrassed me as I was taking him on this trip for his birthday and we couldn't enjoy the dining experience.

I called the Guest Care Dept after the cruise and received no compensation after the call and was encouraged that it was my fault for not changing the gratuity plan while onboard.

I am very disappointed with the service I received as I saved a lot of money to take this vacation. My advice is to not prepay the gratuities so that you can give it to team members that earned it. I wish that I could have that gratuity amount returned. I will be choosing other cruise lines in the future.",2,1
"Moist delicious Red Velvet cupcakes from the Cheescake Factory at AJ's with a cup of Illy coffee, a beautiful thing. Also, the most consistently friendly and helpful staff of any food store its size in Tucson. The bakery staff, yes, definitely, but also  the AJ's staff at large. (I was there for two specific things from the butcher counter, then wandered over toward baked goods. If you've been there before, you know there's only one way that ends; You're leaving with some sweet delicious thing.)",5,5
"Amid the Chinese characters, the white sign says, ""Chinese Restaurant"".  Funny, cause this hole in the wall is in the middle of Chinatown.  But to say this place is a hole in the wall is misleading.  This puts all holes in the wall on notice.  The dining area is closet-like and the open kitchen not much bigger.  They serve food on styrofoam plates and bowls.  And the food is plain.  So why is this place always busy?  Maybe because this is like many restaurants in the side alleys of Siping Lu in Shanghai.  It's no accident most of the customers are from the PRC.  We usually get the steamed dumplings (xiao long bao), fried rice cakes (called ""sweet"" rice cakes on the menu, even though there's nothing sweet about it), but everyone seems to get the Hot Noodles.  Everything is pretty cheap.  The dumplings aren' the best (skin is thicker than it should be and the meat bland), but for $4 for 6 dumplings, it's a good small lunch.  The rice cakes are also bland and has the additional of scrambled eggs, which is unsual, but is filling enuf.  

All said, if you're out for cheap food and an authentic PRC or Taiwan experience, this is the place for you.  This gets 2 stars from me, but my daughter begged me for one more.",3,3
"Our dog had a great stay here and was very well cared-for.  She came back well-exercised and happy, and was relaxed enough to eat all of her meals while she was there.  We initially had a less-than-perfect experience with pricing -- when we made the reservation on the phone, we had a very different understanding of what the price would be; we apparently signed up for something that cost extra, and this wasn't clearly communicated by the person on the phone booking the reservation.  HOWEVER -- the owner was very quick to rectify the situation after we picked our dog up.  It's a shame that the one-star givers don't just give the owners a chance to remedy their complaints, because this does damage an otherwise lovely business that deeply cares for animals.  I'd recommend that Holiday House give a very clearly-stated price breakdown on their website, the same way other boarding facilities do.  Again, thanks for taking such good care of our pup and for helping us come to a fair resolution.",5,5
Great experience!!! I went to shooters world looking for a birthday present for my husband. Everyone was extremely helpful and I left happy and ended up with an extremely surprised hubby!!,5,5

"Sorry my posts are so bipolar but I've finally figured out this place, the buffet isn't good but their dinners and full menu really are. The best part of this place is they deliver which is great for when you're craving Indian but don't want to leave the house, $20 minimum order though. Try the Lamb Tikki Masala or the Sag Paneer. Best Indian downtown.",4,4
"Nice staff, nice decor - Joanne Gaines shabby chic/farm house look. Always busy, nice outdoor seating in deck w/fans. Just not a fan of the wings. They don't do trashed wings & even when requested dry & well done, they come out kind of soggy. I think they may grill their wings as opposed to frying them. Billy G's wins on the wings front. Good place for families or watching a game at the bar.",4,4
"Wow! Can't speak on the traditional Taiwanese food, but as for the pizza? 5 star. I tried both the General Tso (my favorite) and Curry Chicken pizza, and both came out hot and fresh. Nice dough, perfect melty cheese, great balance of flavors. My only regret is that I didn't discover Mei's pizza sooner!",5,5
"Great swamp tour, encountered lots of alligators and other wild life.  Beautiful and relaxing! Learned a lot of interesting facts!",5,5
"I am proudly say that they have got the best hummus & foule around fletcher. U don't have to think twice before going for it. I would had liked the bread to be a little more fluffy n soft though. Also, the Kalayah with lamb is great; it feels like quite the authentic type in terms of ingredients. Price is good & value for money in terms of taste n quantity. Quite, clean atmosphere for an afternoon lunch. Try soon!!",4,4
"I've been coming here for over 5 years now. I always loved the food. The best Italian place around. However, I've been there twice in the past 6 months and I've noticed a HUGE change in the food. It is absolutely terrible. How can u have an Italian restaraunt and have dirty Mexicans cooking the food. The pizza used to be out of the world now it's just right disgusting. I don't know what happened to this place but they need to fix it and go back to how it used to be. I'll never be going back again",1,1
"My love affair with South Grand continues, and I recently found myself at Mojo Tapas on a gorgeous Wednesday night. Nowell G wandered by me on the patio and advised I get a pitcher of mojitos, but when my friend refused to drink them with me, I just ordered a mojito for myself--sans pitcher. I went with the lemon basil version, and it was refreshing, and as Nowell promised, quite strong. Major win! It was a little sweet for my taste, so I'd add some extra club soda next time. A good mojito is the best reward after a long and tiring day, I tell ya.

We only tried a couple of things on this trip, and the first was the beer battered grouper. Let me first admit this... I'm pretty sure I'd eat someone's shoe if it was beer battered. It's just so delicious! The grouper was perfect, especially for someone who's not a fan of the ""fishy"" taste. It was served with an awesome mayonnaise/aioli (I'm improvising here, apologies for lack of specifics) which was the perfect compliment. I could've ordered double and still finished them all.  Buuuut that would be disgusting, so I didn't. 

Next up was of course the baked goat cheese! I order it at every tapas place to just see who has the best version. Barcelona's is still my personal choice for baked goat cheese... Mojo's version was pretty ""meh."" The goat cheese to tomato sauce ratio was not good, and the bread seemed like it was the kind you buy from Schnucks last minute when you find out your mother in law is coming over for dinner. It just wasn't very special.

Our service was alright, but there was a big event going on inside so the staff was a little distracted. I'll definitely be back... I can never say no to tapas! Or a good mojito! Cheers, Nowell!",4,4
They are honey garlic and salt and peper chicken wings. So disappointed! They all ocer cooked and even has the bitter taste. The worst chicken wings i ever had!,1,1
"Went here yesterday for lunch around 11:30 am just because I needed to use my Groupon. If you guys are not on Groupon and getting local restaurant deals get on it now! Its a good way to experience new restaurants and a fraction of the cost. My voucher was good for $20 dollars of food with no restrictions. It is really hard to decide what to eat here because its something my boyfriend and I are not at all familiar with. But the waiter recommend getting the meat platter (T2) because it had a little bit of everything, and trust me that platter was huge.It was the size of a XL pizza pan! Prior to our platter coming out, we had these amazing super hot flaky triangle ground beef appetizers. These were soooo good! I wish they didn't come in 1 piece. It cost about $5.50 for two which is a bit pricey. The platter arrive shortly and the waiter let us know what each of the food was. There were about 4 vegetable dish and 3 meats. I have to admit i didn't enjoy all the dishes, but most of the meat ones I did. Because we were using the roll up sour bread as edible utensils we were getting full super quick. We managed to finish all the meat dishes though. Overall the experience here is amazing, I would definitely come here again but I would probably take it to go. I think the food would taste so amazing with rice and me fueling off rice each day it is a must!  It might not be for you but its really great to experience once in your lifetime.",4,4
We weren't ready for this place... GO HUNGRY! We were told we have to go here by multiple people - one of the very few Friday brunch spots and one that ISN'T super tourtisty- we got there right at 10:02 am because we were told it fills up fast and that it did. We weren't even the first ones there (maybe #21 & 22).  Huge portions and a great 2 for 1 brunch cocktail special.  Rally cool spot too with a nice outdoor eating area that can book larger groups - not a bad spot in the place. Food comes out super fast too. Only knock is that it was freezing inside sooo bring a sweatshirt cuz this a must go.,5,5
"Had breakfast and intending on going back tomorrow for lunch. Food is excellent, atmosphere cool and cozy, service magnificent. They have indoor and outdoor seating.",5,5
I must say  i kind of miss before they redid this mall. Some of the old stores,3,3
"My best friend and  I have stayed at Ace in several cities in the US, when she is able to come over.  (I am American, she is British).   The NOLA Ace seemed promising, with the great coffee shop and lovely roof top deck.  However,  we went to have dinner there (it was 5:00pm, we had been out  since 10am).  They told us (with a  1/2 empty dining room) they could seat us at 8pm, but we could have dinner in  the  bar, same menu.  We ordered from the bar, got our food (appetizers and wine), and then sat at our table for  an hour  and a half with dirty  plates.  3 servers walked  past our table and didn't flinch.  4 other couples left because they were not  being acknowledged.  Keep in mind, there was no info regarding the ordering/bar process aside from the Greeter, who completely ignored us after seating us.  We Waited for an hour and a half....no acknowledgment, dirty dishes on our table.  We asked to speak to someone.  Finally, we got up and went to the lobby bar for a drink.  We then got the attention of the bartender, who asked us to sign off on the bill.  Incredibly rude, terrible service.  Ruined the Ace experience for us.  We will not come back.",1,1
Showed up a few minutes early. Was extremely friendly and professional. Explained what he was going to do and got to work. I'm very pleased with the finished product and the price I paid. The sectional sofa I had cleaned only took an hour and it's already dry! I did ask about dry time too and he was spot on. Thank you!,5,5
"Really good Seafood stop.  Love any of their soups.  And all seafood, blackened or fried.   Grouper is great either way!
The workers are always very nice even during the 'round noon busy time!!!!  A few of us....cohorts....go 2 or 3 Fridays a month and Maderas never fails!
AND once in a while we get rewarded with a freeby of something good....a nice bonus.",5,5
"Honestly I dine out 2-3 times a week in Philly and i know good food when I see and when I don't. This restaurant misses the mark almost completely. 

My wife and I started with a cocktail at the bar. Our reservation was for 7pm we arrived 15 minutes prior. The place was pretty quiet for a Friday night at 7pm. The bar staff is very friendly and pour a mean drink and very fairly priced. Two top shelf cocktails under $20. 

We were sat 10 minutes past our reservation time in a table for two in the back of the dining room. I noticed several open tables by the window and the hostess kindly explained that those tables were all ready reserved. I kindly asked her to see if a manager could get us a window table as we made our reservation two weeks out. She said she would check with a manager. A few minutes later we were moved to a window table. 

We opted to do wine by the glass a lovely Australian Pinot Noir. We started with three oysters (very good) Beet Salad very oversalted, onion soup tasted like onions and simple syrup two bites was enough. Main course Himachi with an inedible shellfish custard as the waiter put it and far overcooked, Ribeye with fries and bernaise was ho-hum. I asked the waiter the grade of the ribeye prior to ordering and he stated USDA Prime no way no how was this prime. I was very hungry so I finished it and all the fries. 

Dessert was very good house-made Ice Cream and Warm Vanilla cake. 

Overall not a disaster but why bother when there are so many other well established better restaurants in the city. I would suggest go to the bar have a good cocktail enjoy the view and have that be it. I don't see this place making it as a restaurant. Its been open almost  two months and the kinks should be worked out in two weeks.",1,2
It was an extremely busy day in St. Louis.  The Cardinals game was changed from a 6:15 start to a 12:05 start.  I stood off to the side of checkin and watched as several people tried to check in early because of the early game.  The level of professionalism that the employees showed helping people was 2nd to NONE.  I will never stay anywhere else in St. Louis.,5,5
"The waitress Felicia was great, we came in with a large party and she did her best to provide great service to us all. On the other hand the chef has a heavy hand with the salt and food was about a 6 on a scale from 1-10. The manager Julie was called because one of the orders was incorrect and we wanted it taken off of the check. Julie stood there for 10 minutes going back and forth about how she would not take the food back even though it was untouched. She was extremely rude considering that it was a party of 20 patronizing her establishment. Piss poor service I will not be back.",2,1
"One of the worst collision repair shop experiences in my life.  They lied straight to my face about my vehicle.  They give you unrealistic timelines. They had our vehicle for about 3 weeks on a simple repair with minimal body damage and wasted my time on multiple days because they screwed something up or half-assed the job. I will give them one thing, their painter did a good job.",1,1
My first Phily Cheese steak.  A great experience and a local favorite.  The BOMB had everything on it and it hit its target.,5,5
"Mangia, for the WIN! What an awesome date night experience! You start with walking in to an open air oasis bar and dining room where you are graciously welcomed and seated. On Friday and Saturday you do have to make a reservation so be sure to call ahead and also confirm you are coming. It's $50 per person and that doesn't include drinks, tax, or gratuity. 

We were a party of two so we were sat with a another party of two. There were a lot of larger groups but it doesn't matter how many people you have because it's family style and you'll be seated with other people plus your party anyways. We started with cocktails and martinis. I had the Valentini which was pomegranate juice, vodka, and limoncello. My bf had the aperol spritz which was aperol, prosecco, club soda, and orange twist. Both of our drinks where nice and simple yet tasty. Definitely not a craft cocktail but what you would expect of a solid drink. Later with our meal we enjoyed the house red wine which was nicely priced at $6 and very delicious with our pasta dishes. And after dinner we had the Tom Hagan and the Mangia-tini which were both very refreshing and light.

The food changes regularly but the dishes we had were super tasty and filling. You have to take it easy on each dish and remember that more is on the way! It was great to meet new people and hate a meal with them. Through out the meal everyone Dances and sings which helps you to digest and not get that give me a nap feeling! 
This is an awesome concept and you can feel the love in what they are doing here. Mangia was definitely one of my more enjoyable date night meals.",5,5
I've been here before and enjoyed it. But this visit was terrible. The new hostess Brittany was very sweet. The rest of the staff was short and rude. I never leave bad reviews but it was that bad. Without even stopping at the table they told us as they walked by that they were out of two things we ordered but said they would have to just bring it without that stuff because it was against policy to change orders. Very disappointed.,2,1
"Needing lunch, we checked Yelp for some suggestions and were not disappointed with this one! Wow! The Green Table has a varied and creative menu, wonderful wait staff and such delicious meals that we will be making the trip from mid county a lot more often! We brought my Dad who is not a plant-based eater and he devoured his lunch!! Thank you!!",5,5
"Great bar food.  The got plenty of TV. They sometimes serve breakfast when the have soccer games on the weekends. It is mostly the English premier. And they all NFL games and bowels games on.
and sometimes during the weekends on the English premier league games they have breakfast and it's very reasonable.",4,4
Amazing experience.  The food and wine was absolutely fabulous!!!,5,5
"I went to a wedding at the Union Bank Inn and it was the classiest wedding I've ever been to. I was the Maid of Honour and we rented a room to get ready and relax in on the day of the wedding. It was beautiful, the bed had a luxury mattress and sheets with high thread counts. They had complimentary wine and chocolates waiting for us. I was especially impressed with their service, which was always prompt, classy and courteous. The space that was rented for the ceremony and banquet later was intimate and elegant, and they had lovely natural lighting for pictures, chair covers and an amazing food spread, both for dinner and later midnight snack. This was the best wedding food I'd ever had, bar none! Steak skewers, satay, succulent seafood, spankopita bites and more. The hotel's located right downtown with a top-notch cafe/restaurant for dining, grabbing a night cap. The rates are quite high but if you're part of the wedding party they give you discounted room rates.",5,5
Penang is amazing. I'm in Philly for work for a couple days and Penang came highly recommended from my friends and totally exceeded expectations. It's a must stop if you love food.,5,5
"I took my wife here for dinner Friday night. Had a 6:45 pm reservation. The staff was amazing, and so attentive.  I had their special; pork belly over polenta with cherry tomatoes, roasted mushrooms and Italian sweet & sour sauce!  Such a unique combination...it was so delicious my wife was jealous!  ;) cocktails were excellent too as were the wine and tap choices.  This is a great place to eat!!",5,5
"Awesome place for unique flavored desserts! Most of their stuff is around $3-7 with larger cakes being around the $25-35 range. 

I tried their chai cheesecake bar which was nicely spiced and creamy. The dulce de leche truffletart is dense and delicious with a nice earthy coffee taste. I've also had the cranberry swirl cheesecake that had an amazing flavor and texture. Their desserts are super yummy but some are a little too sweet for me, so it's hard to eat a whole piece in one sitting - though that just means more to savor for later! 

A very cute bakery for single serving desserts or larger cakes for hosting. I'll definitely be back to try more!",5,5
"Poor service.. food mediocre...waited way too long and no compensation except an offer of ""complimentary "" juice@",1,2
"This is a beautiful restaurant! It's as classic as they get! So very colonial period  decor but updated in areas that give it a fresh feel. The area around it makes this a wonderfully scenic restaurant for dining and of course weddings. The filet is in my opinion the choice meal. Very nicely prepared in that it's seared on the outside and rare to medium rare inside. It holds it's juiciness and flavor well. Asparagus and the baked potato male for a traditional meat meal! I hope to be back at Christmas. Every meal at the table was, by discussion, excellent. I didn't have wine to comment on that subject.",4,5
Eating at Ralph's is like traveling back in time. The space is a beautiful old style setting with delicious tradition Italian American food. The veal parm and chicken parm are out of this world. People who complain about this restaurant are people who really don't know about traditional Italian American food. I recommend sticking with the classic dishes that you'd expect to be amazing from such an established Italian restaurant. To me the atmosphere is the best part about going to Ralph's. You really can't beat eating delicious food while drinking wine while Frank Sinatra is playing. If you decide to go here; I recommend going with a group of your best friends and family.,5,5
"How do I describe all of the flavor at Ichicoro Ane? Umami. Indescribable goodness. I want more. I love Ichicoro Ramen over in Seminole Heights and expected another ramen experience here...but it was surprisingly better!

First off this restaurant is significantly larger than the Seminole Heights restaurant and there's an even better vibe at Ane. Walking in reminds me of the entrance to a restaurant in NYC or LA. Very trendy, yet laid back all at the same time. Plenty of seating with sections compartmentalized by Asian horizontal dividers. Cool murals on the walls and fantastic hip hop mood music (I mean damn good hip hop...I was impressed that I heard The Pharcyde playing). 

HubbyStanks and I came to spend time with Mark H. and Gigi who recently dined here, raved about it and loved it so much they decided to host a fun dinner. When we got to Ichicoro Ane to my surprise they had a special table set up of friends we hadn't seen in a while and they had a grub fest all planned out!

The drink menu is crazy! So many exotic and trendy drinks. Gigi raved about the Black Mage, so I convinced HubbyStanks to get it. By the time I looked over to get a sip he had already downed the whole thing. He's not the cocktail type...more of a 'straight up' kind of guy but he really liked this charcoal drink. I had a Matcha Green Tea On Nitro and although it's a non alcoholic drink it came in a cocktail glass so it looked like I was doing something. ;)

We ate our hearts out. It's so hard to pick faves when EVERYTHING was good. We had SMOKEY YUCCA KORROKE, CORN, OKONOMIYAKI, KANI GYOZA, HAMACHI KAMA, TOFU KARAAGE, WANI NASHI AMIYAKI, HANA YASA and also had a beef Udon soup that was out of this world, but wasn't actually on the menu yet.

You can't go wrong with any of those. The dishes that blew me away the most was the Hamachi Kama which is a Broiled yellowtail collar. The skin was so crispy and the ponzu soy sauce was perfect! It reminded me of eating Filipino Tuyo, yet a lot more sophisticated! I'm still dreaming of the Wani Nashi Amiyaki, which is a big grilled avocado with fried garlic and umami seasonings. If I could just eat the fish and avocado every day I'd be a happy girl!

So after chowing down we all went to a special lounge. HubbyStanks was in heaven as the owner's large selection of scotch and whisky was on display. He and some others tasted whisky while the rest of us were served Halo Halo. I grew up on Halo Halo and I'm not the biggest fan anymore...especially because I hadn't had it the way I'm used to eating it in Hawaii...however this Halo Halo wasn't the commercial mess you find at the Filipino festival. It was the real deal. It brought me back...and yes I ate it...it was good and authentic...except for the rice crispy on top. :) 

The owner of this Japanese inspired restaurant happens to be Filipino and is a wonderful host! You can tell he puts love into the recipes and the restaurant. So much soul In Ichicoro Ane.

So, Gigi told me that Ane means big sister. I should've known that because It's close to what Filipinos call their big sisters: Ate (pronounced ah-ti).

What a wonderful night out! Such a great place to chill and have an exotic meal. I can't wait to come back and share this experience with more friends! Thank you Mark and Gigi for having us. We had a blast and were blown away.",5,5
"Looking for seafood you can share with your friends? This is your place! The combos are perfect to enjoy with family and friends.

The place is very clean, beautiful and staff is super nice. Just take a look at our combo! We ate it all, it was delicious. We will definitely go back here!

In addition, if you are looking for good drinks after a beach day, you should go here! They are really nice. Our favorite was the piña colada!",5,5
"I signed my partner and I up for the four week childbirth prep course because I wanted something more in depth than the one day hospital course, and because my mom has told me how helpful her Lamaze classes were when she had us. I searched everywhere for Lamaze but didn't find any classes and figured this one would cover similar principles. Unfortunately, this class was mostly lectures and slides on what to expect during labor and delivery, and didn't have much practical skills training at all. There was none of the sitting on the floor with your partner working on breathing or positioning techniques like you might be envisioning. In the entire 10-12 hour course, there was only about 60 minutes total of hands on practice, which was disappointing. It felt like most of the information we learned in the remaining time could have been self-taught from watching videos, reading books, and doing the hospital class. 

We left each class not feeling very prepared and ended up having to do a lot more research and watch instructional videos on our own to give ourselves the practice we felt we needed.

For those of you who don't plan on reading or watching videos or doing any other self-prep, and have no idea what labor and delivery might entail, this class might be a good one stop shop to get that information. But for those who were hoping for hands on practice and more of an interactive workshop course, this class might not be right for you. 

The breastfeeding class that was included in the price was much more informative, with useful, straightforward advice on how to breastfeed successfully.",3,3
"I highly recommend this business. The owner Mahmud and his employees are professional, friendly and provide excellent customer service!",5,5
"We saw the high reviews for this place on Yelp and decided to check it out.

We've now tried the stromboli and cheesesteaks. The stromboli is 4 stars, but the cheesesteaks are 3-star tasting for us. We leaned toward 4 overall due to the friendly service.

The cheesesteaks needed salt, but as I've mentioned in other cheesesteak reviews, this lack of salt happens, and I get it when they want to let you season it yourself since tastes can vary. That aside, the overall taste was bland. The meat and cheese didn't stand out in any way, and the roll was not as fresh tasting as other places (like Thunderbird, right down the street). I don't think Alfredo's is trying as hard at cheesesteaks as they are at other things, so this is probably not a big surprise or insult to them. They seem to really stand out with pizza instead.

So pizza-wise, we did like the stromboli. We had the Italian stromboli and it was very good. There was a nice proportion of ingredients, and the crust was done just as we like it. Not burnt or too thin, like the trendy places do these days.

Another reviewer mentioned that quality is not as great on Friday/Sat, so we did go to Alfredo's on another week night.

All in all a good choice for stromboli/pizza cravings.",4,4
The make the best burger I ever had here. If I was going to the electric chair I was have this burger before they flipped the switch. The beer selection is great as well.  The fried greens beans are also a great app.,5,5
"We will drive to Montecito just to enjoy the heavenly Gnocchi and the Tre Lune brand Pinot Grigio, not to forget their delicious appetizers and pizzas. 

The Tri Fungi pasta is also a must!

"This is hands down my favorite  restaurant in philly. I grew up coming to this restaurant with my family, came about 1-2 times a month. The same waitress is also there, and it's so great to see her sweet kind soul. 

I just have one complaint. The  (the side dishes) have gotten worse over the years.  is probably the most important ""part"" or food in the Korean culture. I just wished that they would have better quality side dishes. Also I don't recommend ordering anything but the soft tofu soup and the galbi. My grandparents ordered a Korean seafood noodle dish which was about $13 and there was nothing in there. Literally nothing. Just noodles and 3 pieces of shrimp and other seafood. But other than that I love coming here for the only the . C",4,4

"Very rude employee. I spent $60 for my son & I to have a fun night out. $25 a ticket for entrance, $5 extra a person for the haunted hayride. As we entered the haunted hayride line, I pulled out my wallet to give the employee our tickets. The employee saw my law enforcement badge in my wallet, and I'm guessing he thought I was trying to get on the hayride for free. He began saying ""What are you doing, trying to flash your badge? You think that's going to impress me? I was a cop for 25 years?"" I then removed my already paid for tickets from my wallet and handed them to the guy. I explained to him I wasn't trying to get by on anything and I had already purchased the tickets. This made the situation very uncomfortable and my son could barely enjoy the rest of the evening because he was so upset about how this guy spoke to me. Again I paid $60 for a nice night out and this guy was very rude and ruined the evening for my son and I.",2,1

Gonna give this place a 4.5 b/c of the smell and the people working there. The ladies taking money were prompt and sweet (direct but sweet). The people preparing the food behind the partition looked well groomed as well. However the people bringing the food from the back left a lot to be desired (#LookedLikedDrugAddicts). To top it off no one wore gloves and handled raw food and money without washing constantly. Despite all that I STILL ate the food and it was EXCELLENT.,4,4
"One of my reliable dining options in Philadelphia.  I only ordered takeout from the old city location and I couldn't stand the service of the Manayunk location.  University City was just right.

Not the best Sichuan ever, but best in Philadelphia.  Cumin chicken is a standout dish.  Tea smoked duck is fantastic.  Dan Dan Noodles are a subject of daydreams at work...

Service at this location is friendly and efficient.  Food comes out fast, but it's always busy there so the turnover keeps it fresh.  The portion sizes are huge so come hungry.  Additionally, they have some solid beers on tap.  Nothing like two pints of Dale 's Pale Ale on tap with your spicy Cumin Chicken.

Two issues that keep this place from finding hip, Chinese perfection:

1) consistency of spice level.  Sometimes my dishes would be burning and other days too pedestrian.  Don't understand the wild swings I experienced.

2) lots of hot oil.  The secret is oil.  Lots of oil.  Some dishes more than others, but it can be offputting for some.",4,4
Great food and friendly staff. Love Margarita.  She's our favorite waitress. Their shrimp Quesidillas are the best.,4,5
Great coffee served quickly with a smile. Enjoyed the steak and cheese breakfast roll. The Apple fritter was delicious. Also enjoyed the reclaimed cool art.,5,5
"Boosting my review up after visiting 2x within the past week.

They used to have a CL Deal, so it didn't hurt your pockets as much. I still believe 9oz for $22 is overpriced at Cru and when buying a 9oz pour of Prosecco at Armature - it's $16 w/out including tip. The only redeeming quality is that you can bring your wine cups from their Armature location to Cru in S. Tampa to trade in for a house wine for free. I did just that recently and found their White Blend Spanish house wine to be very drinkable and so tasty - would pay $8/glass. I would only return with this promotion &  snag this deal!

Charcuterie is their specialty and they have Happy Hour, again (*Happy Dance*)! Service was great - we had the whole place to ourselves in a weekday & were checked on often.",4,4
I was really excited to try Cate Zone it has been on my list since rave reviews I read last year. We got there right when dinner opened at 5pm and the restaurant shortly filled up with people waiting outside for a table. I ordered the hot buns to start and share with a friend. I got the hot fish as my appetizer and my friend got a hot chicken dish. Both came with jasmine rice to share. The neighboring tables had gorgeous looking fried rice and I was a little disappointed you couldn't get a side portion but I'll just have to try it next time. The food portions were huge and delicious. My fried fish had lots of chili peppers and tasted really fresh. The only thing we weren't a fan of were the hot buns they had a strange flavor. We waited a good 20 minutes to find someone to get us our check. A couple tables nearby actually waved their arms to get people to come. I'm not sure if this is what they expect but I find it rude so I waited until I found someone nearby. We had lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Will definitely b,4,4
"Their burgers are always consistent and the food is pretty decent. Unfortunately, their cocktails are some of the worst in Nashville. They charge $10-$12 a pop, and they taste like watered down drinks you would have at a frat party in college. The service sadly matches the cocktail selection.

We will still go occasionally when we need a fast-casual option, but only for burgers and beers. We steer clear of the cocktail selection these days.",2,3
Immediately greeted as we walked in by a nice lady. There was sanitizer right in the entryway. This is a large store with lots of vintage items. Worth a look if you are on Magazine Street.,4,5
Bartender chick is rude came in to try and watch Monday night football bar was empty only one here I was just trying to kill time before I meet up with my girlfriend. I got a beer and she charged for my beer right away and she offered me a menu I said no cause I want to wait for food. Funny how she hounding me cause I think it's weird for being charged for my one beer right away with not one person els In here. She begins to ask where I go that don't charge you right away after I get a beer I say Buffalo Wild Wings Bullys and other sports bar  she continues to say well you have to order food also which I was going to. But not anymore   Funny considering when I asked for a beer she didn't  ask to check my ID.  But it's ok I'll take my Buisness elsewhere probably why no ones In here,1,1

"We didn't feel like cooking dinner and I was in the mood for some good noodles. My husband suggested this place, sad he hadn't visited in years but remembers it being great. WHY NOT. 

When we got there, I was worried we would have to wait forever for a seat but it was less than 10 minutes. It took a long while for a server to come take our order. Since I we waited so long, I knew exactly what I wanted: shrimp puffs to start, water, Malaysian iced tea, curry chicken with coconut rice for him and Cantonese chow fun for me. 

The shrimp puffs were minced shrimp wrapped in bacon and fried. So hot, and fresh and perfect with the sauce on the side (tasted like honey mustard). EXTREMELY HOT...as in maybe do not give to children unless you cut open and leave to cool for quite a while. These came out first after a decent Wait. I expected the waters to come out first with the other drink. Actually those came last, and only after I asked 2 other people for water (after the hot puffs). I felt like I was begging for water. 

The curry chicken was very enjoyable. I ended up sharing with my husband since This was brought to the table about 20 minutes before my entree, the chow fun. The chow fun was also good, I would have liked more shrimp though, only 3 pieces in my whole large bowl. The noodles were perfection. 

Even though I only gave 3 stars, that's mostly for  the service. The food itself was great and very recently priced: a lot of bang for your buck, I think everything we had above came up to $20. 
I saw a lot of families and large groups around so this place maybe great for a family dinner or a friend group get together.",3,3
"Terrible Customer Service.  I stopped in to order from their menu for a to go order.  The young lady behind the counter was short, curt,  and did not allow me to finish a single sentence without interrupting me.  As I started to ask the question again, she acted disturbed, stomped her foot and answered the phone all at the same time, leaving me standing there dazed and confused.   I left and went to their competitor SUPER CHINA, where I was greeted with courtesy, and had a wonderful dinner.",1,1
"A minus 0. Flowers ordered thru 1 800 Flowers and this florist did not go by the specifications. A large bouquet was ordered and paid for but this florist made a small. On 1 800 Flowers website they actually give measurements of the bouquet you are buying so you will know how big you want it. When I called to say a large was paid for and sited the measurements, I was told size doesn't matter! What? Yeah, she actually said that! We paid for a large bouquet you sent a small I said!! I was told by Catya to get my money back from 1 800 Flowers!! My advice, go to the supermarket and put together your own arrangement for a third of the money!! Avoid this business!",1,1
"I was shocked to receive a ticket for running a red light in Tampa because I could see from the photo provided that it was not my car. I started by reconstructing a record of where I had been in St Pete at the time of the citation. I was fortunate that I had been at several places and had receipts that were time stamped. I showed up at the time of my hearing in Tampa to be told the hearing was cancelled. A police officer suggested I contact the Ticket Clinic for help and it was the best advice!  They were courteous, professional and returned my calls. Best of all they handled everything at a nominal fee without my needing to appear in Court.  I highly recommend them!",5,5
"What a waste of time!

I've got ET quote of $650 for one bedroom . 

Home Depot gave a quote for $406. Documented. Of course I decided on HD offer.

Next day the ET called to offer $406 match and next day installation. I agreed to take this ET offer. 
For next few days I wasted lots of time calling ET customer service to find out where is the technician who never showed up. Yesterday got a message from the ""Tri-State manager Eric"" that they will not install it for less than $600.

"Do not like the Ramsay-fied menu or remodel.  Went during the holidays and had a reservation for 8.  Sat us on a high table in the dining room.  Chairs were wobbly and older relatives had a hard time sitting on them.  The aisle between us and the next table was so narrow that the waiter had to keep stepping aside.  They altered the calamari recipe...did not taste the vinegar/zing.  Halibut with risotto was very good.  Crab cakes were also good.  We live locally and our out of states guests look forward to this place every year.  Unfortunately all of their dishes were just ok.  They do not want to go back in 2020.  Bottos eliminated the side salad/soup and choice of pasta that used to come with entrees.  Not a huge deal but as past customers people look forward to those things.  Bread on the table was a huge disappointment also.  My son wanted to go to the market next door and buy some bread and bring it back lol  There were several small tables that were on top of each other, so if you go out as a couple just a head's up.  Have some gift certificates so will use them soon since I am unsure about this place in the future.....   Go to the market next door and get the pignoli cookies - very good!",2,3
"I'm a picky eater, so it took forever for me to choose a restaurant for a nice dinner during our weekend getaway to NOLA. I finally settled on Muriel's and we couldn't have been happier. From start to finish, everything was phenomenal.

My husband told them it was my birthday, but I'm not comfortable being the center of attention. The hostess seated us and quietly whispered ""Happy Birthday!"" Patrick and Phillip were the perfect wait staff tag team. We both chose the 3 course meal; I had the house salad, double cut pork chop, and bread pudding and my husband had the shrimp and goat cheese crepes, drumfish, and flourless chocolate cake. I also had the Honey Child cocktail, which was a big departure from what I normally drink, but very refreshing. The salad was a great combination of manchego cheese, onions, and mixed greens and my husband raved about the crepes. Our entrees were piping hot with the pork chop juicy and flavorful and the greens cutting the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. The drumfish was light and flaky- my husband loved it. The flourless chocolate cake was almost like a cheesecake or mousse, but very good and my bread pudding was fantastic with a nice caramel sauce accompanying it. Patrick brought out 3 scoops of ice cream with a candle, again quietly wishing me a ""Happy Birthday!"" and Phillip ended the night with the same.

It's not a cheap meal, but you get your money's worth between the drinks, portions, and service. I wouldn't hesitate to return and will recommend it to others.",5,5
"The food was ok but the ambiance is wonderful and very festive in Christmas.

"I have been using this Meineke Car Care location for a couple months now. After having multiple issues with appointments, follow through, and intense sales-like atmosphere, I left the dealership that I used to go to and switched to Meineke because it's close to my work! I have yet to be disappointed! They always are so honest and go above and beyond in order to help the customer. Today, after my tire pressure light would not turn off, I called this meineke on my way home from work to see if I could pop in and they would check my tire pressure. an employee named Andrew answered the phone and he said I could absolutely stop by and he would be able to quickly check my pressure/fill my tires if needed. Right when I arrived and you walked out of the building and immediately pulled my car over to check it! And quickly was able to add a tiny bit more air to each tire and call it a day! I would definitely recommend Meineke Car Care of Land O Lakes!",4,5
"Good place to go to catch a game and beer. They have great drink specials and decent bar snacks. Their menu is a bit more diverse than I would give them credit for, but I would beware of things that sound too creative. 

My friend really enjoyed their creamed chipped beef. The zucchini curls were a neat idea but kind of greasy. I enjoyed my sandwich but was a little surprised by my side of broccoli, as they basically gave me a massive stalk. It was cooked well but was a bit difficult to eat.",3,4
"Sheer brilliance is the only way to describe this little slice of Heaven that descends to earth each year. My fiancé and I were fortunate enough to attend this year's shindig, and fortunate is the optimal word because this event sells out within mere minutes of being available online. Try to imagine the image of Valhalla you had when you first learned of it in your grade school readings of Norse mythology... now take out all those smelly warrior types and put some food trucks and a jazz band (Halfbrass) in their place and there you have it. 

Parking looked like a mess but I really wouldn't recommend driving to the event - there is too much delicious beer to enjoy. My recommendations: cab it or make a friend in the 12 South area exclusively for the purpose of spending the night following the event (yes, it was that good that one should form a friendship solely based on this event). We entered the gates and were given name tags and were greeted by a crew of volunteers directing us to tables with pens (to write our names), the food truck area, the greatest line of porta-potties to person ratio I have seen at any event (really good call for a beer tasting event) and finally the beer garden. My hat goes off to the organizers of this event and the volunteers. This was a perfectly run, perfectly coordinated event. Upon walking into the beer garden, one was greeted with the aroma of hops and fermented products wafting into the air. The massive tent holding at least 40 separate breweries stretching the length of a football field was filled with lively conversation as you went from brewery to brewery hearing about the different beers. Every brewer or employee was great to chat with depending on your liking of the beer they had just poured. There is something for every beer palette, and my single regret for the event/day was not having a card
to mark off my thoughts on each of the beers so I could have them for future reference. However, now when we see some of the offerings at other locales such as Craft Brewed on 8th and Stone Fox we know exactly what we like. 

Mark this event on your calendars and make sure you get online early because you'll be competing against me and every other person who attended the event for a spot in next year's event. I haven't been to many beer tasting events in Nashville, but I'm willing to wager this is the best one in Nashville.",5,5
"I absolutely love love love this place! Delicious cactus tacos (tacos are also big, not skimpy at all), chips & cheese dip drool worthy, super yummy roasted corn... really everything i've had here is always delicious, and margaritas to die for! The place itself is beautiful with all the wonderful murals & art! i can't wait for covid to be over to actually sit inside & see the beautiful carved tables & hand painted chairs. extremely safe feeling right now for mask wearing & social distancing.",5,5
Fabulous I think it is the best food I've had in a very long time. I cleared all my courses plate empty. First time we did the dining room..  I had a peppercorn filet that they flambé-d right at our table. Can't wait to go again. &&&& but well worth it. Service & good impeccable.,5,5
Yummy ramen which is also quite spicy. We came here after having a very disappointing pho experience. The lines were long so we got our food to go but that also took some time. Regardless would def come back and get some yumminess again,4,4
"J.B. Dawson's is one of my favorite local bar & grill locations mainly because I don't think I've ever had a bad tasting meal or weak drink there. This dining experience was much the same. My husband and I went in for an early dinner (before the craziness of the last Friday before Christmas) and found no wait at the door. Hubby had a beer, I myself ordered something new (Pip's Gin Lime-Aid) which was really tasty. Our appetizer came out quickly and all of the wait staff was very attentive all throughout our meal. 
I prefer the darker pub style ambience, but I know some would feel like they keep it to dark. All in all it wasn't our first time dining and I know it won't be our last.",4,5
"The only thing that attracted us to this establishment were the two Ford GTs they had on display. The man who checked us in seemed annoyed we asked to sit by them. The waitress told us we caught her on a bad night because she forgot the side of ranch I asked for, the oysters we ordered sat out on the bar for a good 30-40 minutes before she brought them over. At which point, we didn't want them any more since our appetizer and entrees had already come out. The fried pickles were good but nothing noteworthy, same with the po boys. (Alligator sausage and angus pot roast beef.)",2,2
"Wow!!! Delicious!!! I had the #10 lunch special. A gyro, with potato salad and a cup of lobster bisque. Tapioca pudding for desert. All for 11.99. It was all delicious!!!",4,5
I got the gyro salad and a side of the olive salad.  I wish the olives were better quality olives but the gyro salad..... Great salad. Huge portion. Super tasty.,5,4
Absolutely Delicious! Ordered through Uber Eats. The pizza was so good. I ordered a pepperoni and a supreme. Both fantastic. However if you are looking for a good hot wing order here. I hate slimy skin and very picky about my blue cheese. I said it blue cheese not ranch. They nailed it. Crispy skin great sauce and good blue cheese! Got my order correct which is refreshing. Nothing worse than ordering something and getting something different. Thanks! You're my new favorite place.,5,5
Ordered doordash forgot the most important part of the happy meal the chicken nuggets. Called the store and the guy I talked to was incredibly rude. How do you forget chicken nuggets in a happy meal?,1,1
"Oysters were great, service was great, entrees (especially the redfish) were epic. Pecan cobbler is to die for.",5,5
"Came for coffee and dessert after dinner. Had a great time - both were delicious. Great place to watch any sporting event. Jordan, our waiter, was fabulous!  Very courteous, helpful and pleasant. We had a great time and will return.",4,5
This is a nice hotel right on Broad so if you're in Philly and want to go to see something at the Kimmel Center or just want something central to stumble back to after a night with your old Philly friends... this is ideal.  From the cookie upfront to the clean well kept and regulated rooms this hotel runs to a tight ship.,4,5
"Stopped in at 1:15pm on Sunday. There were no cars in the parking lot. Should have been a huge warning. We went in anyhow. Zero customers in the entire place and we waited for someone to appear. We were finally seated and told our server would be right with us. We waited for about 10 minutes. In that time we heard what sounded like all of the employees playing bowling in the kitchen. Someone finally appeared right when we decided we were leaving. No apology for the wait, etc. No way would we have stayed. What an unprofessional, dirty, dump of a restaurant. I will be reporting it to Pizza Hut as well. DO NOT go here. Negative 5 stars would be appropriate.",1,1
"Why his place has any good reviews is beyond me. Got a simple breakfast of eggs, hash browns, bacon, and coffee. 

First off my coffee cup was completely dirty on the inside. Gross!

The hash browns tasted like they were fried in grease that hadn't been changed in a month. 

The eggs were way over cooked. 

And the pre-cooked, warmed up bacon was stringy and terribly greasy. The grease covered majority of the surface area of my plate. 

The service...right on par with the food. Terrible!",1,1
"Great little hole in the wall restaurant serving delicious salads & sandwiches. Food is super fresh & well prepared. Friendly, quick service. Will definitely go back!",5,5
"My bag looks brand new!!! I am incredibly satisfied with the level of communication and guidance provided by the team at Leather Surgeons. Gerry was a delight to work with; he was very knowledgeable, informative and honest regarding the care of my handbag. I am so happy with the results and will definitely be sending in more of my bags for some TLC by Leather Surgeons!",5,5
"I had a great experience! I arrived early to pick out my frame before my dilation and the staff both allowed this and assisted me :) Dr. Terri was so professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Every person in this office is great at their job and worked to make my experience excellent! I will be back and with family :)

P.s they have a great selection of frames",5,5
As someone who works in the service industry this totally bums me out! The veggie burger was dry and over cooked. The small charcuterie cheese only literally came with 4 pieces of cheese and was all thrown on a box with 4 slices of bread and 5 grapes! It cost $18!!! There is absolutely no reason with the amount of people that we are able to serve in the service industry right now that something this sloppy should be happening. We should be sending out perfect orders every time and making sure that people want to come back. I  I literally spent $55 and didn't eat any of it except for my four slices of cheese! Total overpriced bummer! To further add insult to injury the delivery guy brought me a hot can of soda and left my order in front of Someone else's door even though I left specific instructions on where to meet me text me when they arrived. I wish I would've spent my money somewhere else.,1,1
"Pet Supermarket is the Only place I go for my Pet's Care and Food. William runs a tight ship. The store is Always immaculate, the variety is second to none, the Prices are Fantastic and the Employees Genuinely Care about You and Your Pets. You can get Amazing Coupons sent right to Your E Mail too. Do Yourself a Favor, Treat Yourself to the Best Pet Store in Town. Pet Supermarket!!!!",5,5
"Sike, best ramen ever.  They can slap me in the face as long as they serve me that delicious ramen",5,5
"Loved the sushi but... our server was very hostile towards our table. It was disappointing we never got refills on our water and we were never taken care of like we should have been. The waitress took care of all of her other tables and tended to them, but not to us. We tipped well and were polite. Wish we got the same in return.",4,3
"Waited about 7 hours for a rapid test. Got my covid test and was told it would take 2-3 days for results. When asked why it wasn't rapid was told that I didn't ""have enough symptoms"" even though I was around 7 people who tested positive. Others called and they said they only do rapid testing. Pretty insane for waiting all day, missing work just to be left with no answer. After I called back and complained I was told to come back LOL. My so called doctor couldn't even look me in the eyes when I questioned about why it wasn't rapid. Wont be back.",1,1
"Holla cow!  The Holly Shitake pie...OMG.  there has got to be something in this pie.  I just had a heavenly experience!!  The cheese, mushroom and truffle sauce.  I will come bank to edit, because I'm about to have desert.  And wait, the Italian hoagie, omg..fire.
Omg..the cookie, brownie,  the homemade ice cream; honey lavender,  pumpkin spice   and pralines.  
A must stop, especially for pizza",5,5
"I can't even begin to go through everything we have been through with Our animals. PENN Vet has always been there for us. Every doctor gives us the best service. The front desk personnel are amazing.  The students are willing to go to the end of the earth for your animals. Of course it's expensive but it's worth it. Get PetPlan. 

Special shout out to Dr. Harvey. Without her and the internal medicine unit Zuul wouldn't be around!

*White valet parking guy is a jerk off.",5,5
"The Bakery House continues to never disappoint us. We picked up our grandson's birthday cake today and not only did it taste delicious the decorations were so adorable. Last year they did a fantastic job on his first birthday cake and this year they did an incredible job again! 
 So many times either the cake taste good but the decorating isn't great or the cake looks amazing but it doesn't taste great. The Bakery House manages to check all the boxes. 

Definitely 5 stars!!!!!! Thanks so much",5,5
"I couldn't say whether the food is truly authentic, but I can assert that it is delicious. This is a fantastic place for people who enjoy spicy, Asian-influenced food. I recommend the hot sauce style with chicken or the dry fry style with pork (at the recommended spice level).",5,5
"Loved the etouffee and the shrimp and grits.  Our party of 5 had a great business dinner together (with 2 bottles of wine among us), and the check was reasonable.  Lively and jovial, but not too loud to have a conversation.",4,5
"Nope. When I suggested to my husband to run once we sat because he realized it was The Banana Leaf around the corner that he wanted, I should have ignored him and raced out of there. Worst surprise check at the end when we spent $90. 
The special was a red snapper fish whole or chopped up and fried with mangos. 
WTH went wrong??? The fish was so fishy tasting and left with skin on while fried was so disappointing. And who knew that a few chunks of fillet would be $40??? I really wished my husband just got the mango chicken. 
We specifically said no fried stuff or shrimp and she persuaded me not to get a dish because it was fried, then urged me to get a dish that was heavy on shrimp sauce so my husband couldn't eat it, and then urged us to get the market price fish mango which was fried, then did NOTHING when we refused to eat the dish after saying here was something wrong with it and that it tasted off, besides us SAYING no fried stuff. 
I know what red snapper should taste like. I know what a fish should NOT taste like. 
Then 3 staff surrounded our table and told us why we should enjoy it because others hadn't complained. I mean excuse me????
The roti was also a huge disappointment when we found only chicken bone and cartilage in the sauce with the one potato. Yuck!!! Hello i wanted a chicken piece in there not chewing on bone and cartilage.
The huge $100 bill with no apology and ""shocked"" we didn't want to take our disgusting fishy fish dish home. 
The most annoying thing happened right at he start. I asked to sit at the edge area, instead of the middle getting bumped. and was told no it was a 3 top (it was not) and seconds later they sat one person who waited 10 minutes for his companion to show up. I mean. What? Ugh should have gone to banana leaf!",1,1
DR Zucker snd his staff are amazing! I have been going for a few years and have always had a great experience.,5,5
"Great coffee house, very good food. The pastries are somewhat pricey, but I believe they use quality ingredients and that may justify the cost. My wife and I stopped there for a breakfast after the Washoe County School District Wellnes Fair. My wife ordered the Avocado Toast and I ordered a Breakfast Panini and 2 cups of coffee.  Both breakfast items were better than most anywhere else. The coffee is one of my favorites in town. My criticism and suggestion for the Coffebar management and staff is the amount of waiting time and cleaning of tables. Our original cup of coffee was fine. By time our food came to our table our coffee cups were empty. You can buy a refill for less than what was paid for the first cup, which is fair. Problem lies in that you have to go to the end of the line  in order to get a coffee refill. Ten minutes later we made it back to our table with the second cup of coffee, my panini was stone cold. There has to be a better way of doing this, perhaps a line for refills or a coffee wagon, pay as you go. The second criticism is that tables were left with previous customer's dirty dishes, etc. People looking for a place to sit were not very happy. The dirty tables were there for the duration of the time we were there. I should mention that one restroom for so many people simply is not enough (something else to consider). Such a successful business that can elevate their standings by tweaking a few working policies that will allow customers to truly enjoy their experience at the Coffeebar. Their coffee is one of the best in town. Limited parking.",4,4
"Good tasting pizza, perfect portions with the mini, and own is friendly as can be. Highly recommend for lunch. M-F all you can eat buffet for $6.99 or $1.50 a slice (price as of 2/1/2020).",5,5
"One of the better Korean fried chicken places in the area. Out of three fried chicken orders we had, Gangnam style reigned over the olive fried and hot spicy flavors. The peppery sauce was just more satisfying. But what all the chickens had in common was the juicy meat and the light, crispy skin! So good! The radish and coleslaw help cut some of the greasiness away. 
The ddeokbokki was fine. Nice and spicy with a fun chewiness of the rice cakes. But I would stick with the chicken on my next order. 
Overall, I decided that I don't need to go deep into Philadelphia to get KFC.",5,4
Not expecting the food to be as good as it was. The location was also very nice and relaxing. It gives me slightly upscale but in a comfortable way. I'd love to come back.,4,5
"I love Ants Pants. 

The Food is AMAZING - the Bacon Stack (add Avocado to create a near religious experience) changed my Life. All of their Food is to Die for, and they have some of the most innovative specials to come out of any cafe in the City. 

Their Coffee Rocks. But they have one up on any other coffee purveyor in the City - The Australian Coffee. This consists of an Iced Coffee made with Vanilla Ice Cream instead of Ice & Espresso or Chocolate - but being me I combine the two for an extra scrumptious treat. All of this yummitasticness is topped off by the fact that this joint Busts Your Gut without Busting Your Wallet. A Bagel with Cream Cheese and Nova Lox is $3 ($9 anywhere else). 

I would call it Intimate as opposed to small, and it is best to take the attitude of Love Thy Neighbor, as you will be sitting very close to them! As with any place, there are better times to stop by and if you go during the meal rush, you will wait. If course, you can always do Take-Out (yet Another bonus). The Outdoor seating in the back is refreshing and partially shaded, which is nice especially in the heat of  the summer. As long as it isn't during the rush, they don't mind people stealin their internets while sipping on coffee. The staff is incredibly sweet, and keep me coming with their friendly attitude. This is a place that values its neighborhood & its community, and hat helps elevate both through its charm & goodwill.

Final Thoughts: Yummy, Cheap, and Friendly!",5,5
"Every city needs a Mexican breakfast spot like Biscuits!  Between the spicy biscuits and gravy, huevos a la Mexicana, and chilaquiles, our table was extremely silent as soon as the food arrived except for the occasional 'mmmmmmmm.'

There is definitely something on the menu for all tastes and plenty of non-alcoholic and yummy brunch alcoholic drinks!  The portions were huge and everyone left full and commented that it was their new favorite breakfast spot!

Great food, great service, and great atmosphere!  We will be back!",5,5
"I been going and print my pictures in Office Depot for years , this evening lady at the counter informed me that they not longer provide this service and I printed pictures at the same location last week , horrible way to get rid of they customers just because she don't want to be bother .... at her work place !!!!",1,1
"Worst service and worst experience ever. Food took over an hour and when we got it it was cold. Ignored when we needed more drinks.  Table next to us ordered about 30 mins after us and got their food much earlier than us.  Forgot our to go order, kitchen forgot to make it. Was told a manager was involved but no one came to our table. Called later to speak to manager and was left on hold forever.  Will NEVER go back.",1,1
"After hearing about this restaurant from several foodie locals we knew we had to check this place out. We arrived around noon to a long line of fellow hungry diners. Despite being told the wait would be at least 1 hour long we noticed no one budged . That's when we knew this place was IT! After 45 minutes had elapsed our names were called. It was like striking the lottery! As we entered the small, unassuming restaurant we perused the menu and decided upon Shrimp and Grits, French Toast and Mozzarella Sandwich. The Shrimp and Grits were the best thing we had ever tasted !!!!!!!!!!!! Creamy & velvety grits... succulent shrimp in a sauce that tasted like it had been lovingly cooked all day by someone's Grandma. 
The French Toast was simple but again cooked with love. Crisp on the outside yet with a  buttery ,soft tender center. Sublime! 
The mozzarella sandwich was delicious and the potato salad on the side creamy and dreamy! 
Surrey's gets 50 stars in our book! Perhaps the long wait in the cold made everything taste better but we will definitely be back when we are next in town!",5,5
"I've had the jerk chicken, curry goat and oxtail. Food is delicious ! I would suggest calling ahead because the food does take a while. Portion size for price is great !",5,5
"DING, DING, DING!  We have a 5/5 winner.  I'll preface this by saying I've eaten at my share of Brazilian Steakhouses, and this one takes the cake.

If you liked Brasa Grill on Waters Ave. (closed down a few years back), then you will absolutely fall head over heels for Boizao.  Hell, if you hated Brasa Grill, you will love Boizao.  Texas de Brazil, which was originally in Orlando, just expanded to Tampa, and their food is solid, but doesn't compare to Boizao.  Their selection of meats is insane.  The garlic steak and house specials will keep you on high alert waiting for the ""meat guy"" to return.  And the cheese bread (Pao de Queijo) is to die for.  My advice to my fellow yelpers is to go during lunch.  They serve up the same food as they do in the evenings, but for nearly half the price!  It's about $26 per person with a drink (guarana soda).  I've been to Boizao about 10 times, and only had one lack-luster experience.

Side note, if you love Pao de Queijo like I love Pao de Queijo, pick some up in the freezer section of Casa Brazil on the corner of Waters and the Veteran's.",5,5
"Stayed in Tucson later than planned. Needed to eat before we headed home to Phoenix.........long story short - the place looked inviting from the street!  No pre-conceived expectations just glad they were open!

LINGUINI WITH TRUFFLE OIL & ROSEMARY - linguini tossed with Roma tomatoes, mushroom, olive oil, rosemary, garlic and a drizzle of truffle oil

These are just words. Words can't describe feelings. I felt GOOD and HAPPY eating this dish along with the plump perfectly cooked shrimp.  Holy cow just writing this review my mouth is starting to water!  Pasta was perfectly cooked. Mushrooms firm. Roma tomatoes were roasted and had greate al dente texture.  It was just a Delightful dining experience.

I regret that I was driving and could not pair it with wine. Next Time!",4,5
Worst company I've ever worked with! Be carefully if giving them a deposit to hold an RV while you work out the financing! They called me 3 days later said they couldn't get me financed! I ask them to refund my deposit! They said no problem! 1 month later still nothing!  This is a very bad company to work with,1,1
"This place is a great place for lunch. I always get the barbecue pork with the noodles. The fish sauce which I normally am not a huge fan of is very flavorful it is sweet and tangy. The portions that's come with the plates that are ordered are big too definitely worth the money. 

The atmosphere is small but clean. I think the owner is a middle aged women who always greets me with a smile when I walk in and that is also what makes this place great. It's a bit ironic because it's called Asian Pho, but I have never tried any of their soups but my friends have, I can't speak for them but they seem to like it too.  

Their spring rolls are good too, just next time pack some more noodles in them! The peanut sauce with it is a mouthful of deliciousness. I am a person who likes my spring rolls full of noodles and shrimp.",5,5
"I am going to start this review by saying that normally I do not like 'Posh' restaurants.
Livery has been the exception.

We were immediately sat at a comfortable table and given a menu.
We were in a slight rush as we were going to a show but everything was quick and we didn't have to wait long for anything.

The food was really good and I implore you to get their Yuca Fries. They're great.
Good selection of the menu and things are easy to understand.

My one qualm... Our table was a little too close to the tables beside us which made it a little difficult to settle in.",4,5
"Absolutely love this place, I haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet. Even the raw meat is fresh ready for the pot. The staff is friendly even the owner mike greets you with a smile!!! If I can eat here everyday I will definitely do just that. Oh and let's not forget about the prices... it's affordable for the amount of food you're getting",5,5
"Classic jersey diner fare in a bright chrome setting.  Large & reasonable lunch specials bring the crowds.  They also have mini & regular dinner specials, the obligatory 10 page menu and a salad bar (unusual but seemingly popular here).  It's a tight squeeze inside and the parking lot fills up fast during peak hours.   

The food itself was standard.  Big portions of decent food to me means the experience really hinges on the service.  One day I had a super friendly & accommodating waitress who packed up my rice pudding from lunch to-go.  The next time I was charged for the supposedly included free dessert.  So it goes...",3,3
The rolls at Logan's were so good! Warm and buttery. I tried the zucchini fries they were great too. I liked how they had a lot of different sides to choose from. I got the veggies on a skewer and I would get them again. The steaks and chicken were great. Will go again!,5,5
"I LOVE this place!! It is my favorite spot in Indy. It's been awesome to watch Ian's journey from starting a little food stand with a panini press at City market to this full service restaurant in Fountain Square. This masterfully-prepared plant-based food is delicious and satisfying for both vegans and omnivores. You can expect friendly and very attentive service during your experience. It's obvious that everyone here takes pride in their work...and they should because it is outstanding!  Thank you, Ian and staff, for pouring your hearts into your work and creating an awesome dining experience for all.",5,5
"Stopped in for lunch this afternoon after visiting an area farmer's market and one of our favorite wineries. We have dined here many times and have always enjoyed both the food and service. Today's experience was a little different. Our waitress was clearly having a bad day and unfortunately it reflected in her attitude and service. Her communication was abrupt and short. It was almost like we were bothering her. She grabbed my empty soft drink glass to refill and my husband asked for another beer. She didn't acknowledge his request and returned with my ginger ale. Not knowing for sure if she had heard him, he very kindly asked again. She finally responded with a sharp, ""Yes, I'm getting it.""  At that point I believe the hostess overheard and asked if she was feeling any better. She answered that she was not. The hostess then called someone and asked them to pick her up a bottle of Excedrin. I found the whole exchange to be somewhat unprofessional and inappropriate. Don't get me wrong....I completely understand that we don't always feel our best at work and that our performance can be affected. However, maybe it would have been best if she had taken the day off or even a break to get herself together before attempting to interact with customers. Today's experience won't deter us from returning to one of our favorite local restaurants. I just hope that the Excedrin helped and her day improved for the sake of herself and her customers.",4,3
Great service and great price! Amro was helpful in fixing my tire. He also was honest and told me I did not need a transmission flush when another shop had said I did just to make a buck. I appreciate the honesty.,5,5
"I love Padaro Beach Grill. Very happy to have this restaurant in Carp. The food is fine, the service is fine, but the real value here is the outdoor area for kids to play in a closed in safe place. The sand box is excellent, and the grass and trees make a fantastic place for games. 

I recommend taking kids, grabbing a pitcher of beer, and spending a couple hours socializing with friends.

For food, I like the grilled chicken sandwich, sub in the pretzel bun.",5,5
Nice trip through the city - knowledgeable tour guide - comfortable bus.,4,5
"This place is excellent! The lamb fell off the bone, the beef was cooked right and flavorful, and the prices were beyond fair. The service was also outstanding. I'll be hitting this place up on a regular basis from here on out!",5,5
Boy i don't know how the last review came about but we have been dealing with Yardley Auto Body for years and they are the best!!!!,5,5
"Really good sushi and a really great happy hour! $2 beers, $4 wines and $5-$7 sushi rolls! Cute decor on the inside, had little oriental umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Kinda small inside. Sweet staff. Would recommend and eat here again.",5,5
I love this place before covid...gotta make my appointment soon! I know it is just as professional..see ya soon!!,5,5
"Southgate rocks!!!! Consistently offering the best Korean BBQ around. Standard go to is the Bibimbap or Hot Stone Pot paired with an appetizer such as the wings, Brussels sprouts or spicy pickles. They also offer a diverse craft beer and cocktail list to sip alongside dinner. This place is delicious!!!!  The daily happy hour menu is a great add on to check out.",5,5
I have bad TMJ and I received injections last week! Staff was great and friendly. I will be going back for my next set of injections here!,5,5
"My new favorite sushi place in philly! So I agree with some of the other reviews, it is VERY hard to find amazing sushi in Philadelphia. It's just difficult to come by, while this sushi was not the best I have ever had, the experience was five stars. 

First, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! 

We tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.


Overall the place and the sushi varieties are very modern, definitely worth a try if you're near this area of philly!",5,5
"Dishonest! Beware! 
I called 317.662.2958 on 5/21/2021 @ 2:06pm and spoke with a woman in reservations who said she was on-site. I told her I was getting a room for my father who was passing through town. I asked her if the outside pool was open, and told her it was very important to my father that the pool was available because he was driving for many hours and needed to relax in the pool for his back. She said it was open.

 She also told me ""Good news! The best rate available with your father's military veteran discount was $135 + tax."". ???? I told him I was able to see it on Priceline for $75 + tax -- $60  less.

Well, I ordered it through Priceline and my dad shows up and the pool was closed. And the lady just avoided the question when my dad told her we had asked if the pool was open.

Then she tried to get $150 cash out of him for a deposit...and wouldn't take a credit card. Finally when my dad threatened to walk she begrudgingly acquiesced and didn't make him pay the deposit.

Other than that, the hotel was great, clean, and a good night sleep was had.",1,2
"Wow. We went here for brunch on a Sunday, expected to wait a bit longer for food/drink. But didn't expect to be there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. After an hour and a half we asked about the food and the server hadn't even put the order in. We all work in the service industry so we understand busy. But that's insane. Our server wasn't even apologetic. Maybe the worst service I've ever had.",1,1
"I love these people and the way treat my dog and me. Dr Olden-Stahl is ever-patient, ever-composed, laid-back, and delightful. My dog is always calm in the exam room, and always happy to prance into the building. We have been there several times because he reacts adversely to vaccines. Dr Olden-Stahl, God bless her, is comfortable with a one-shot-at-a-time-wait-two-weeks-between vaccine schedule, and it works well for us. I love the fact that she administers a mercury-free rabies vaccine, and, upon request, will gladly do a titer test to determine actual need for the other vaccines. I have nothing negative at all to report; however, when I made my first appointment, I was looking for a vet who would allow me to stay with my dog at all times. I was told by the receptionist when I asked that this practice indeed allows that. It has never been offered. It's OK, but perhaps the reception staff should be reminded that the pets are in fact taken away from the owners for ear checks, vaccines, etc.",5,4
Been here few time. Good food wish they can dine in right now. Will come back again after this whole over.,5,4
Friendly service and great food!  I love Tito's arroz con gandules it's the best. Frappes are really good too.,5,5
Today my boyfriend and I went to this amazing fast food (still gourmet food) outback and we both agreed that the service provided by Melissa was OUTSTANDING! She broke the menu down for us and we were able to find exactly what we wanted. We were just going to get a fast meal food dinner after shopping but this experience was like none other. I dont know the executive chef's name but he menu is a keeper,5,5
Less than mediocre food. Terrible service. And much better music in the other bars. I feel like I'm at Friday's.,2,1
"I got the sourdough Jack and tacos. Always good. The wait in the drive thru was long especially since we were the only ones there. But for someone who does not have a Jack in the Box in her area, they are always worth the wait.",4,4
This is by far the WORST experience I have ever encountered with any hospital. I have a family member who is currently on their death bed and this hospital is DENYING ALL VISITORS at this time because of a PREVIOUS accusation the nurses and 1 doctor have made. He's on the 2nd floor with multiple brain abscesses and Doctor Barns and her fellow nursing staff have denied all visitors and placed him in an isolated room. This is outrageous. Something needs to be done about this hospital and their poor staff. We have had several meetings with the doctors and all of them say they cant go against what doctor Barns has put in place. And when she is asked for reasoning why she says it's because of his past. So THANK YOU dr. BARNS for becoming a heartless doctor and taking what could likely be our last days away.,1,1
"The store is currently under renovations but when I went 5 or so months ago I worked with Gigi who was so sweet and not pushy at all. She was very honest and patient with me looking at many different styles and I wasn't too sure what I wanted when I got there. But she helped me find a perfect dress at about 1200, with a coupon of 150$ since it was my first time there that you have to use day of.  I did a payment plan on my dress and it was pretty easy set up and process payments. 

When I got my dress tailored, the seamstress Bridgetta Was hands-down the most amazing person I have met. She took the time to listen to any thoughts that I had about the dress, offered any advice, took her time with me and was patient. She also was very honest and experienced. She has so much knowledge that she was able to show me different things with the dress that I was considering but didn't know how to ask for. My dress was beautiful before it was altered but when she completed the dress it was everything that I had been looking for.",5,5
"The other day I stopped at this location at McDonald's. The drive-in line was long so I went in the store to order. I was the only customer, I waited five minutes to be waited on. The employee never greeted me, took my order and never said a word to me. My order number was written on top of the receipt. Five minutes later a paper bag was put on the counter by another employee. She never called my number, I had to ask her was this number...###.?  The manager of this location needs to talk to his employees about common courtesy they show to their customers. McDonald's employees think they deserve $15.00 dollars an hour? Are you kidding me?",1,1
"Probably my least favorite meal in Née Orleans. My mussels were overcooked, bland and fishy. Tried a couple other dishes at the table, the crawfish étouffée was delicious but everything else was middle of the road. Not particularly good or bad, just middle of the road at best.",3,2
"The Mesa office staff and estimator were very easy to work with. The movers were nice, but they damaged two pieces of furniture. A painted chest has a 1.75"" x 1.25"" area with the paint rubbed off down to the wood. An antique telephone table has a long and deep scratch across the top. I stained it two weeks before moving, and the top was dry for at least ten days.  I will have to refinish it. The boxes were stacked with the writing underneath 70% of the time, making it difficult to know what was inside. Unfortunately a good personality doesn't compensate for a poor job.",1,2
"If I could give negative stars, I would.  I usually eat in, but called for take out on 10/4 (bad idea!).   I called and the person identified the restaurant as the wrong wrong location.  I apologized, hung up and hit redial...the person answering identified the store location correctly.  I placed the order, waited the prescribed 30 minutes for the meal and attempted to pick it up.   I entered the restaurant and was greeted by no one.  I went to someone that worked there and asked about take out orders and was directed to the take out order station near the door (not sure why I didnt see it).   I stood there and an employee came up to the station, got something from the register and walked off.  This employee never acknowledged me, said someone will be with you in a minute, nothing.  Someone finally does come to help and looked shocked when I tipped her.  After paying $45 for my order for two, I left.  A few minutes later after reviewing the order, I found the grilled mushrooms skewers were RAW...they'd never even gotten near a grill.   The loaded baked potato consisted of a potato wrapped in foil and the steaks were over cooked and inedible.  The positive notes about the visit were the young lady that assisted me was pleasant the bread was warm.    I can chalk that up to the most expensive bread I ever ate.    Thinking there must not have been much management on hand last night, I went online and filed a message to Logan's online.   I waited until today to contact Logan's on Facebook.   I have not received a response from either communication channel.  I called the manager personally to nicely let them know about the visit.  I was told they had a problem with the person on the grill, they knew about it and I wasn't the only one that had a problem last night....thank you for calling....click.    Really?!",1,1
"Not sure why this place gets so many raving reviews. They're understaffed and the non lassi food they serve is like a huge jambalaya and way oversauced with spices. The mango lassi was the only positive experience from this place. Probably won't be back here, unfortunately. Would not recommend",2,2
"Don't go!  The carpet was sticky and wet, there were flys in the lobby, and furniture was damaged. Based on all the other reviews, it lived up to its poor quality. Do you self a favor....Don't go!!",1,1
"This is one of the best places to get fast food. It is a nice building just built not to long ago with a ton of staff. There is a kids play area inside the building and a two lane drive through. 

The one thing that I don't care for is there drive through. There is 3 workers and they try their best to go from car to car but you will see a few cars on the next lane go before you. Makes me wonder how they keep that together and in order. 

The meals are good and so are the shake!!! Their parking is fairly easy. I always see space available. 

Heads up they are closed on Sunday",4,4
"Delicious food, friendly staff and fun atmosphere with live music weekend afternoons!",5,5
Last night in NOLA. Landry's didn't disappoint!  Server was friendly and knowledgeable. Food was delicious!,5,5
"Highly recommend Amerifi, LLC. I worked with Eddie and John on multiple fundings for our franchise business and each and every time they came though when I needed them most. I was able to secure $200,000 in less than 48 hours and the process was amazingly simple. This is a great company that focuses on the long term relationship. They take the time to understand your business goals and finance needs and I value them as a trusted partner. Thank you Eddie & John!",5,5
I had a problem with booking through a third-party and I was at my wits end when I decided to call Hotel Mazarin and speak with them directly.  Gregory made things right immediately. This is what customer service should be and I'll be staying with Hotel Mazarin again in the future.,5,5
"Melanie at the UA Passport office was fabulous. I had a renewal and my husband was getting his first passport. They do not process renewals there, but Melanie took a moment to look over all my paperwork and took a terrific photo for my renewal application. (Way better than the one Walgreens tried to sell me! :-P) She also verified how much my renewal would cost, where to send it and how. 

My husbands application process also went smoothly. We were both very pleased with the service.",5,5
"so delicious and worth the wait. We went in on mothers day and graduation weekend. they were absolutely slammed! We decided to wait because my mom really wanted steak and she was very happy that we waited. The wait was almost 2 hours but the staff was SO nice and handled everything really well. The hostess was open wih us about the wait and kept us updated as best as possible, the bartenders were so nice (FYI no booze are served, just wine and beer), and the service was so good when we got to sit - they definitely had a busy night so keeping the patience and smiles was a big deal at this point! Mussels were so good, the goat cheese was out of this world! Bread was wonderful, all specials were phenomenal. Me and another girl got the seabass which was SO good and nice portion but it was really salty and they took it back and agreed that it had been oversalted but it didnt matter because the service was great and we were full on wine and apps.",4,5
"The absolute best bartender works here ! Lillian  is fabulous- grace, art and talent in action.  We came in and sat at the bar.  Lillian immediately clued us in on the happy hour deals and the food was phenomenal!!! 
We are from Baltimore so seeing barbecue shrimp wAs a bit of a turn off ( I envisioned tons of barbecue sauce over shrimp). Luckily we were befriended by some lovely military folks who made food recommendations and reassured us.   
Get the BBQ shrimp -awesome! 

Best happy hour !!!!!",5,5
"What a fun place. The historic perspective of this old stage Coach stop was what brought us here, but we were amazed by the quality of the food. 

We had the Tri-tip and the quiche, both were excellent.  

Staff was friendly and efficient. The ambiance is awesome. 

After dining you can wonder around the various old building. 

Do you want to eat at a place that time has forgotten?  This is your place",4,5
"Record Street Brewing has been talked about around town for a while, and especially during these crazy times it is good to see a new business opening up and taking a stab at continuing to build and develop the Brewery District here in Reno.

As the name would suggest, they are located on Record street, and the intersection with Fourth, inside the extensively renovated old Alpine Glass building.  Color me impressed, as they have gone all out in refurbishing the property, and it looks amazing.  Gleaming brew tanks, glamorous pizza oven, decorative lighting, cool murals, and decorative memorabilia on the walls.  Outside there is a fenced-off patio area, while on the inside there is a whopping amount of seating space to help maintain social distancing standards.  This is even further added to by the addition of an attached large event space (The Alpine), which will hopefully host lots of cool concerts and gatherings once the current crisis has passed.

The focus of the beer menu seems, at this point, to be focused on lighter, easy drinking styles, with prices for most pints start around $6.  The Malt Rose is a nice blonde.  The High Roller is smooth and mellow pale ale I rather enjoyed.  A special release Scotch-ale, Flowers of the Forest, has a really interesting flavor and maltiness to it, with proceeds from sales currently benefiting Truckee Meadows Firefighters Foundation.  But the Devil's Haircut was a truly exceptional Bock, which packs amazing flavor and is surprisingly easy drinking for a 7% beer.  There are no flights, crowler or growler fills available yet, but that is hopefully on the horizon.  In addition to their own brews, there is a full bar selection, and currently they are partnering with Black Rabbit Meadery across the street, bringing them on as guest taps.

The food here is very focused on pizza, along with a few other house specialties.  For the first visit, I had to go with classic cheese, which I think is a good way to assess any new pizza place.  When it came out, I was impressed by the size, being about a 12"" or so pie, which is a lot for one person or just right for two people.  Having been baked in their fancy pizza oven, I was thrilled to find the crust was done perfectly, with just the right amount of charring to my taste.  However, I was a bit let down by a rather bland sauce and the cheese was clearly over-done and not terribly flavorful.  HOWEVER, my second visit we tried the Whiskey A Go-Go, and we were pretty blown away by the great flavors and toppings.  In addition, the green serrano wings are truly exceptional, and I highly recommend giving them a try.  The cheese pizza started at $12, and the prices go up from there based on what toppings you get on it.

The service here was incredibly friendly and prompt.  There is also some neat swag and merch for sale.  Parking is found either in the lot next door to the building, shared with the businesses across the street, or just in street spaces around the neighborhood.  And since it does weigh on some people's minds, let's address the elephant in the room about the location: the large amount of homeless.  To an extent, this is not anything the business owners can control.  So far there doesn't seem to be any problems with people around the property in regards to interactions with customers.  And besides, it is good to see businesses trying to help revitalize and improve the area.

All in all, I think Record Street Brewing is yet another welcome addition to the Brewery District, and I am happy to see them here.  Will for sure be returning and seeing what they have on the turntables.

Cheers, guys!",5,5
"The BEST sushi place I have ever been. Whenever Me and my husband are craving sushi we come here. My favorites are the highway 17 and the Sweetheart roll! Definitely recommend them! 


Me and my husband come so much that all the staff recognize and remember us and they make us feel so welcomed! We love it!",5,5
This place is a very good spot to go to if you need a convenient dentist whom will work on around the clock to fit your schedule. One good thing about this place is that they are open 24/7 so there is never a time that an emergency can't be dealt with. Another reason is because there are very respectful dentists in this building. Great place if you need immediate treatment.,5,5
Decided to give La Scala try because it was close to my hotel and it's cold as hell outside.  Found out it was restaurant week and decided to give it a try. For the starters had the brussels sprouts and it was everything.  I would highly recommend it. Then I had the pappardelle & sausage bolognese and it was on the money.   Topped it off with a chocolate cake dessert.  It was good. However I wished the cake was warm. This is just my personal preference.  I would definitely recommend this place. Cool spot for a date or to watch the game. They had the playoffs on the TV's at the bar.,4,5
"I did the free walking tour that was on the Yelp events and it was so cool to learn about the history of Ybor City. The tour kind of jump started me into learning even more about Ybor City and Tampa. It was also awesome to see the interconnectivity of the information I learned at the Henry B Plant Museum and the Ybor City State Park/Museum. I live coming to the Saturday market at the park as it's a great way to buy local and get fresh ingredients. 

Most people come to Ybor though for the bars and nightlife. I personally like Zydeco because they have live music, great food and great drinks. I also like Acropolis Greek Taverna and 7th & Grove which is black-owned. 

There really is something different for everyone though starting at the entrance gate to Ybor all the way down to the iconic Columbia restaurant. If you like cigars or distilleries or going out to the clubs, that is the majority of Ybor after dark. There are a few places you can take kids though if you're there during the day. Ybor can be really wild at night so I'd say don't bring the kids after dark. The police are almost always present especially since people often race down the main strip. 

They are still developing though and adding new restaurants and lounges so I think it will be interesting to see what Ybor becomes.",5,5
"Was staying in town to visit a friend and picked this Another Broken Egg Cafe location to get breakfast on my way out of town. It was an egg-cellent choice. The food was hot, hearty, and tasty. The server (Raven) was friendly, informative, and just the right level of attentive. Thanks for a great breakfast!",5,5
"Came in on a weekend late afternoon on a whim. I love Indian food and the bountiful flavors that come with it. I loved my trip to India, so I was looking forward to this meal.

The two samosas ($5) we enjoyed as appetizers were tasty as were the small sauces that came with it.

We just ordered two basic Indian dishes - the butter chicken and tikka chicken. Both dishes came with basmati rice. I will say for $15 each, I was expecting slightly larger portions, but it was delicious. The $2.99  naan was also very good, fluffy and nice and warm.

I was a little surprised that this was the first time I think that I ever dined at an Indian restaurant and there wasn't a bunch of side condiments offered as toppings. No raita, no chutney, no nothing.  I asked for a little dish of raita to top my dish with and was told NO.  I mean jeez, I would've paid for it.

The other thing.... the smoke alarm battery was giving out the annoying loud beep endlessly, a sign that the battery needs to be replaced. It should be a quick fix for the staff to replace the battery and certainly would enhance the dining experience.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the meal and am thankful my dining partner treated me to a lovely afternoon.",4,3
"So this was my first experience having a colonic, but it won't be my last. Cheryl wants you to feel comfortable. The process was quick. The place is clean and sanitary.",5,5
One of the best restaurants in Carp!!  Love the food here!  It's walkable distance and the staff is always super nice!!  Very chill!,5,5
This place is amazing great food and tasty very friendly servers warm surroundings will be back to try something new every thing looks great,5,5
"Usually they have great varieties of beer and friendly service. Have done curbside pick up a few times in the past with no issues.

 But last time I placed an order for delivery, I received 4 beers that were obviously damaged with the seal broken, and didn't realize it until I arrived home.

The four pack from Troubled Monk were all damaged over carbonated, and when poured only about 100ml of liquid. They should not have been given to a customer and whoever was placing them in our vehicle would have been able to see the damage. Beware and check your beers before heading home if get curbside pick up!",3,2
"We wanted to love this place. It is cool for anyone who grew up in the 80s/90s. I'd give that part 5 stars. But the service was terrible and food was cold. I understand the current circumstances with COVID. Most places are short-staffed. But our server was not nice and gave the impression she was bothered by having to do her job. Here's the kicker! When we went to close out our tab, she'd selected the 25% option as a tip and then handed the device to me to sign. That was downright shady! Thankfully I noticed and changed it. As a former server, I still tipped 20% despite the crappy service she provided. After the less than pleasant experience we had at Gen X tavern, we won't be back.",3,2
"This gym has gone thru an owner change, and a complete make over. It looks like the make over has run all of the clients away that I used to see here. When it was owned by Wendy Black this was a fun place to work out, and everyone that work here knew every member by name and they would greet you and were always up for conversation. Now the staff just stares at you, no greeting, no welcome, no good bye have a nice day, nothing. Very stand standoffish now, except for a young lady that work Sundays. She always has a smile for everyone. The music they play continues to be too loud and the most annoying music I have ever heard. If you wear your own ear buds, you can't enjoy your own music for the loud back ground noise. The equipment is pretty antiquated compared to a place like 24hr Fitness or other large gyms. A change in staff and new equipment would greatly improve the atmosphere. If you have difficultly going up and down stairs there is no elevator to get to the basement workout room and locker rooms! Seems like that would be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There are definitely nicer gyms around town.",2,2
"Excellent brewery. Not as well known as some others, but the eclectic selection of seasonals is well worth the visit. The interior is a clean, industrial, and small. The employees are always a joy. If you enjoy a good craft beer, put this on the top of your list for an interesting highlight to your day. 

Currently enjoying a Bananas Foster Strong Ale and an Imperial Salted Chocolate Sweet Stout.",5,5
"Like other reviewers have stated, you have to visit here whenever you are in Santa Barbara. Again, let me reiterate. You have to visit here. Why? First of all, it's free to visit here and there are guided tours which are also free. Secondly, if you go all the way to the top, there's an observation deck with a great view if it's a clear day.

Now onto my actual visit. When I first walked by, about to enter, I admired the architecture of the building itself. Being from the East Coast, architecture styles where I'm from and Santa Barbara are completely different. Compared to the courthouse in NYC, give me Santa Barbara's any day of the week. Granted, given the number of criminals on trial on any given day, it might be a problem if NYC had this courthouse but ah that's a problem that could be fixed at a future time.

Entering the building, I was immediately greeted by a docent or volunteer. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what exactly he was. Nevertheless, said docent/volunteer welcomed me and informed me when the next tour was. Since I was not in a rush, I decided to do the tour. While waiting for the tour, I spoke with the docent/volunteer, who in addition to having information on building tours, also had information about nearby attractions. While waiting for the tour to begin, I conversed with the docent/volunteer who encouraged me to explore on my own and to go all the way to the top for the view. Since I had some time left, I decided to do just that. I can't remember how I got up there but I think I took an elevator and walked up some stairs.

Unfortunately, on the day that I went, the weather called for clouds early on then sun later on. I was hoping that the clouds would clear fast (although when I arrived in Santa Barbara in the morning, that wasn't the case) but when I reached the top, my wish had not come true. It was still cloudy but not as bad as it had been before. I'm sure that if it had been a sunny, clear day then there would have been nice views of the surrounding areas. For me though, the views were somewhat limited due to the clouds (damn weather) but I still agree with other reviewers who say the view is wonderful. I definitely snapped a few pictures while there and savored the view as best I could despite the clouds.

On to the tour itself, the guide led me and a couple around the building, pausing in various places to describe where we were exactly and to explain the significance of each place. Definitely worthwhile as I wished I had eyes on the back of my head so that I could see what I had missed- namely, the artwork all over. During the tour, if memory serves right, we even went into a courtroom (I think I went on a weekday).

Overall, a definite worthwhile experience and I cannot stress this enough. You have to stop here if you are ever in Santa Barbara.",5,5
"Visiting Reno and decided to have some Asian food.  101 doesn't disappoint.  The decor was classy and pleasant and our waitress is very friendly.  We ordered Shedded chicken salad Taiwan style, stir fried rice noodle, pineapple fried rice, and ginger fish soup.  We didnt quite enjoy the fish soup, but everything else is delicious. The portion is huge and the quality is great yet the price is very inexpensive.  We also enjoy the leftover and still amazed by the quality ingredients they use.  The waitress told me the restaurant has been open for 9 years.  we will definitely come back next time when we visit Reno.",5,5
"I've been going to this place for 10+ years. I've had many a good time at this joint. Birthday parties, work get togethers, bowling nights or just pool with pals. Its an old gem that I hope sticks around. Bowling, pool and arcades. The foods generally good. 

The only issue I might raise is it can be expensive-but I believe they have deals for bowling/ pool throughout the week.",4,5
So this little place is so inviting. My first visit was during Devour Indy and the place was packed. The staff was so inviting upon our arrival and found us a seat within minutes. The waitress was very helpful. She gave good recommendations and we loved our dinner. The drink specials are pretty tasty. We've found a great spot for date night.,5,5
"I've visited this particular BK for breakfast a few times since it's kind of close to my job. There was an older lady that worked there and she was so sweet and pleasant. She would kind of chit chat with you if you had to wait. The last two times, I haven't seen her there. I usually get an egg and cheese croissant. Sometimes two. Today, I ordered two and a large cherry Coke. I repeated my order twice. Verified it on the screen. I thought the croissants were 2 for $4 so when I got to the window, I asked about it. Apparently that's all the croissants EXCEPT for egg and cheese. If it has meat on it, it's 2 for $4. Okay, fine. Doesn't make much sense to me but whatever. It took two clerks to figure that out and they were so nasty in their responses. Got my food and went on my way. Took a big swig out of my drink and it's not cherry Coke. It's diet. I don't drink diet anything ever. So after verifying my order on the screen and repeating it, it still isn't correct. And asking a question gets you nasty looks and responses. There wasn't anyone else in line. And the inside looked pretty empty also. I don't know what's so hard about getting orders right. I visited about a month ago and ordered an egg and cheese croissant and large drink. When I go to eat it, it's a sausage, egg and cheese croissant. I won't be back to this location.",1,1
"My husband and I were excited to have breakfast here after eating at the Chattanooga location. There was a 30 min wait, which was no big deal. We ordered coffee while waiting for our table. When I got the text our table was ready I walked over and told the hostess while my husband was still waiting for our coffees 20 later. The hostess was putting down a couples names and told them they would get a text when there table was ready. I showed the hostess on my phone that our table was ready. The Waitress said follow me. I started following her when the couple who was just putting there name down walked up and sat in my seats. When I told the hostess the problem he didn't ask the couple to get up from our table in the front of the restaurant instead he stuck us in the back far corner on stools looking into the very loud kitchen. I waited ten min for a waitress to bring me water and never saw her again. My husband in the mean time is still waiting on our coffee at the now empty counter. So after 40 min we got our coffee and we left.",1,1
"I sat for fifteen minutes waiting to be served, when I was eventually waited on me and my two boys ordered wings.

Couple next to us came in ten minutes after we did.

Their food came out before us, going on 40minutes and no wings yet.

Absolutely worst experience ever here.

The waitress said she was tired and hated people.

Well I think waiting now 50 minutes for wings is stupid.",2,1
"Wow. This place has some really great reviews out there but not many here on yelp. I've been wanting to try it out for awhile and finally stopped in today. It's small, quaint, and decorated so cute. The smells are amazing. This place gives my other little Italian spot a run for its money!

Their pizza dough is amazing and you get some as the bread for the table. It's covered in olive oil and  garlic and it was so amazing we had two orders. 

I wasn't a fan of the meatballs - they tasted like they were more bread crumbs but the server told us they were fresh which makes the texture different. They were not bad at all. Just a little mooshy. 

We wanted to try as much as we could because the menu seems to have a million amazing things on it. I got spinach and ricotta ravioli. The portion size was perfect and the red sauce (which i call gravy) was just like my moms!!!! 

The pizza was phenomenal as well. We got one with ham, artichoke, mushrooms, green olives. The flavor profile was insanely good. If you do not like soft bottoms of your pizza crust , you may not like it but i love it that way. 

They also have a ton of dessert options. We tried the limoncello cake and i can't even put into words how soft, light, moist and delish it was. You cannot leave without trying that cake. 

I can't wait to come back and try more things!!!!",5,5
"I'm not sure where to begin with the praises. Food or service? Both were exceptional at the Garden Brunch Cafe! As we waited to be seated a very nice lady came out and told us about how they do things here: homemade from scratch using mostly organic ingredients! We were all so hungry after church we couldn't wait to try it.

Our server was so warm and genuine and helpful. I ordered Southern Pecan Coffee and a breakfast bowl (potatoes covered with homemade turkey sausage, eggs and cheddar) and a side of bananas foster pancakes.

Holy! The breakfast bowl was seasoned so well I literally licked my bowl. And the pancakes.... Truly one of the best things I've ever eaten. The buttered rum syrup was rich and decadent but not sickeningly sweet. It had real depth of flavor that I will be thinking about for years to come. Really. They were that good.

I didn't have a bad meal my entire time in Nashville, but brunch at Garden was probably my favorite. Don't miss it!",5,5
"This is a review of our college visit.  We've taken son #1 on quite a few of these and you learn what to expect.  First you sit and see the powerpoint presentation, then you take a tour where you see spots on the campus like a cafeteria, dorm room, classroom and usually the student fitness center.

The person who gave the presentation was not prepared.  He fumbled his way through it and forgot a few things.  Instead of saying something like ""when I remember that, I'll get back to it"", he literally just stood there amid silence and waited.  Very awkward.  The screen that they used wasn't mounted on the wall, it was on a cart, so if you were sitting in the back of the room, you had some problems viewing it.  There was also a delay because they were running out of seats.  We made an appointment as everyone else did, so they knew how many people were attending and could have figured that out earlier.  So this was not that great of a first impression.

Our tour guide was very friendly and thorough and open to questions.  She took us to various spots on the campus, but not what we have experienced other places.  We didn't see a lecture hall, we didn't see a cafeteria, the dorm room was optional at the end of the tour.  The campus itself is very pretty, but I think we needed to see some of the basics.

Overall I was disappointed at our experience.  They did call us 3 days later and ask if the school was in my son's top three choices.  I think a survey on our experience would have been more helpful!",2,2
Great spot for brunch. Lines can be very long on the weekends. Best to go with me to mid week.  Decadent,4,4
Huge selection of brews and a little deli all in one.,3,5
Liked this hotel very much. Staff very polite. Room very clean. Lots of pillows. Continental breakfast was pretty good. Variety of food. Loved the little courtyards. Conveniently located. A variety of restaurants within walking distance. Convenient and private parking. Will definitely come back.,4,5
So excited for this new location. There's no other comparable locally owned restaurant on the southside. Got takeout on a very busy holiday (we expected them to be slow/busy) but they were gracious. Everything was good -- the basa and po boy were *delicious.* We'll be back.,5,5
The worst cat fish nuggets I ever had in my life!! SHAMEFUL for even giving this food to a customer. Fried so hard and so greasy it went right in the trash. Never again. I want my money back.,1,1
"This hotel is disgusting and gross!! I got stuck in their North wing, which is above some garages!! The elevator smells like pee!! The room isn't much better!! I will probably sleep in my car!!
I booked through hotels.com, but this is ridiculous!! I can't believe this hotel got any stars, the rating system is a total fail!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$

**This is an amendment to my review.
Dave Fuller, who is the director of service, saw my review. He immediately moved our room. I feel so much better!! Everything in this room is clean and nice!! I can see why this hotel and casino was rated so high!! Their customer service is the best!!**",4,4
"Food was great, I had a cup of gumbo and the red beans and rice. Gumbo was very delicious, be prepared it is spicy since they use creole seasonings but I love that. Red beans and rice is literally what it sounds, if you are expecting it to come with something. I know it sounds weird to eat a whole plate of beans and white rice but its actually very good and filling of course. Waitstaff wasn't that attentive and they do not split checks. Which I don't understand why, this is a great location that faces Jackson square, and their business could do so much better. So if you are with a group as I was, either everyone pays cash or charge it all to one debit/cc.",4,4
"First off, Rollings is NOT on Montgomery Ave. They're on Harrison, so even with a GPS I had a bear of a time figuring out why I was going up and down Montgomery and didn't see them. At the bakery the woman chuckled and said, ""Yeah, we're not where the address is.""

Went for a bialy which was doughy, bland and even the onions in the middle were pretty tasteless. The place has a great reputation so I figure they must be worth the trip for other items.",2,3
Don't waste your money.  Food all came at same time and cold. No utensils or napkins. No server. Terrible.,1,1
"Probably the worst pizza I ever ate. I won't be back.
The toppings were scarce. The crust was blan & overcooked. The selection was lacking.
Note: Not everyone is a vegetarian/vegan/anti gluten/lactose free hippy.",1,1
"Three years ago I wrote a favorable review of Big Bok Choy. Yesterday I frequented the restaurant and absolutely reiterate that this is a great Chinese restaurant. It is not inexpensive, but the food is fresh and delicious and the service is great. Don't eat here if you are looking for a low priced meal. Do eat here if you are willing to pay for the best.",5,5
I would give them less because they charged us $506 to not fix the problem. $106 for a part and the rest for their time. We are still not getting got water. I feel this couple is scamming. Why should we have pay $400 because they can't find the problem. What a couple of scam artist. Stay away!,1,1
"Made a quick stop here before walking over to the Philadelphia Theater Company. I got the veggie tacos and my friend got carnitas quesadilla. He gave his meal five stars, and I feel like some sort of veggie protein would have made me give it a five. It seemed like all I ate was veggies inside tacos, but it was definitely delicious.",4,4
Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a small place to get coffee and lunch. The location of Grindhouse is beautiful and makes for a calm place to eat. Definitely would recommend!,5,5
"So delicious! I ordered a cheese and chicken pupusa and a chicken tamale. Both were just perfect. The cabbage and jalapeno sides are at the table, and they were great, too. And only $5.50!",5,5
Gone down hill .................This place is dirty ! it smells like a dirty dish cloth as well .prices vary from day to day and who ever might run the register .,1,1
"The first time we went to Fries about two years ago I thought it was wonderful --one of the best restaurants in the area.  The wait staff was delightful, and the food was innovative and delicious.  Unfortunately, we have been there many times since, and each subsequent visit was worse than the last. 

I understand the concept of a ""Scratch Kitchen"", but unfortunately in Fries case what that seems to mean is that everything that is scrumptious on the menu disappears in way too short a time.  ""Oh, this is yummy and customers love it?  Bye-bye""!  They had these Country Fried Wings for a bit that had this gravy on them that made you want to lick the plate when you were finished.  Gone.  And let me give props where props are owed--their wings are pretty darned good.  We had the special maple bacon wings last night and enjoyed them very much.  The fried pickles are decent, too.  But the crab bites did not seemed fried all.  Flavor-wise they were okay, but they were soggy and considerably larger than ""bites"".

Another problem with this restaurant in that is that I don't think that I have ever gotten a burger cooked to the way I've asked.  My Autumn Harvest Burger last night was considerably more cooked than ""medium"", and my friend's Swanson burger was DEFINITELY more cooked than ""medium rare"".  Another friend had the Smokehouse Grilled Cheese, and the sandwich was barely warm, let alone hot.  One of the requisites of a grilled cheese sandwich is melted cheese, isn't it?  A third friend did enjoy her chicken tacos very much, but the rice that accompanied them was tasteless and mushy.

Seasoning seems to be something else they are struggling with.  The aforementioned Swanson didn't seem to have any seasoning on it all, despite my friend asking for extra aioli.  My burger suffered the same problem.

We shared the dessert tacos and fried Oreos for dessert.  We'd had the Oreos before, and they had never disappointed.  But last night they were soggy and the batter tasted a little off, as if they had fried them in old oil.  The taco shells were plain and kind of doughy, and the overall dish was just boring.

The waitress was very nice, but she never questioned us as to why there was so much leftover food on our plates being taken away.  I wonder if she was afraid to ask.

If this is the type of restaurant that interests you, I say try it.  Give it a chance. You might get lucky and get there on a good night.  For our part, we given them enough chances.  We won't be back.",2,2
This establishment is easily noticeable from a block away. The orange is a UT orange so in orange country you can't go wrong. Clean establishment and helpful service. First time here so I hope this spot can stay in business and provide something unique for the Germantown area.,4,4
"This place gets better and better for me! The old english vibe of the dark wood and tall bench booths just invites me to come in and stay awhile. And why wouldnt I when they have so many great beers on tap! This last visit, I tried a few different ones, with my favorite being the Porter and Chai concoction, it was delicious! I also tried the IPA and Coffee french press which never disappoints, though I think the server could have filled the press with a tiny bit more beer. Then I finished my night with a pumpkin porter which had the perfect balance of pumpkin and beer, yum! I also tried the fried pickles for the first time and the dipping sauce should be served with everything on the menu, it was THAT good! Another fun fact, did you know they have a photo booth inside! For $3, you get to cram into the booth with your best friends and get your photo taken, super fun! Hope this place sticks around for a very long time.",5,5
"Good God...DO NOT GO HERE!!  Not only are the females rude and classless but they did not greet any of us walking through the door.  After an hour long wait,  not once did one of the many employees apologize for the wait. There were barely any customers in there. They spent their time laughing and goofing off. Not only did I wslk out but at least 8 others did too during the wait. Horrible customer service and employees with no expetience on desling with people.",1,1
I like this place because it's in my neighborhood and it's kinda cute compared to other places in the neighborhood. However I've walked out of here on 2 separate occasions with 2 different eyebrows on my face! It's like they get one eyebrow perfect but can't match the other to it. I've had one eyebrow high and one low. And now one thick one and one thick and super thin on the end. To make matters worse when they showed them to me in the mirror I told the lady I didn't like them because they looked different. She said I just needed to relax my face. . Now here I am again with 2 different facial expressions at the same damn time!,1,2
"I used to like The Jerk Hut. They were a little pricey, but the food was good. I went last night for the first time in years. I ordered (takeout) a jerk chicken platter, a vegetable roti, and side of greens. They had no roti; I'm fed up with businesses that act as though running out of menu items is okay. It's not; fast food joints run out if food! I get home and couldn't believe how small the container was that my food was in. It was the size of those chinese food containers. With 2 small pieces of plantain! And when I saw how little greens $6 buys, I thought, never again. I tried the chicken and rice; neither was what I had had previously enjoyed there. I'll pay a high price for good food, but this wasn't worth half of what I paid. And I'm also at the age where I'm no longer willing to tolerate buying something from someone who couldn't care less that I was putting money in their pocket.  I'm done with The Jerk Hut.",1,1
"If ur looking for the BEST HOT ROAST BEEF SANDWICH AROUND, it's here.  The Muffaletta bread is crunchy on the outside, and nice and soft on the inside.  The roast beef is great, ""shredded"", and topped with this wonderful garlic mayo provel cheese combo, and that's all.  Simple.  Delicious.  

Other than that, the menu is nice, a lot of good options, and the market inside the restaurant is cool too, but the Festa Italiano sandwich is the reason I come here.",4,5
Just saw the bartender at the 2nd story bar tip HERSELF off of my drink. Let's talk about un-southern hospitality.,1,1
"Great food, great service, Joey is a great sever! He was really helpful and polite!  I was also very impressed with how clean the restaurant was and how careful and considerate they were regarding social distancing and sanitation during the pandemic.  We need more restaurants like this!",5,5
"How have I not reviewed OT in Reno yet?!  This place is amazing.  It is an incredible workout via organized classes with awesome music.  You stay with the same ""number"" throughout the workout, so it is smooth and you are never fighting anyone for equipment.  You wear a heartrate monitor and the goal is to get a certain number of minutes in the orange zone, which is challenging and definitely possible.  The workout room is a ""phone free"" zone and I find it SO nice to unplug for an hour out of my day.  The trainers and the ladies at the front desk are THE BEST.  Definitely check it out!!",5,5
"Wow! Historic and so charming. Very clean room and a comfortable bed. Helpful staff. Fabulous bar and restaurant. Being in the center of the Quarter makes life easy to access all that we need - that nasty Bourbon Street, the classic NOLA restaurants, Jackson Square/St. Louis Cathedral, etc. 

In particular, Jo in reservations was especially helpful in discussing rooms and patient as we made decisions. In addition to her, Anne in Concierge was very knowledged in the area restaurants and made suggestions according to what we expressed. Her suggestions were right on. 

The rotating Carousel Bar itself is an experience with an eyeshot and earshot of the live jazz playing there until late. The Criollo restaurant is actually a big deal in the NOLA dining scene, too. Don't miss either of these.

This is one of the last family owned Hotels in America but it's run excellently and very organized. The Monteleone is not about a place to just rest your head, you'll pay a little more but you'll also get so much out of the activities in this property alone.

We recommend and will return here.",5,5
"Lee did a fantastic job on my gel manicure and spa pedicure today. With the pandemic it is typically appointment only, but she was able to get me in as soon as I called and I was the only person in there. The price was great ($55 for the gel mani+pedi) and for a regular manicure it's only $15. She took her time and she was very nice. Definitely recommend!",5,5
"I currently live here. I personally wouldn't recommend over other options. Management is terrible. My a/c broke and it took them a week to get it fixed. My dryer broke and it took them a month to get it fixed. I got NO updates and would constantly have to call, and get bs answers from the office staff. We have an overage utility charge every single month, which was never an issue for me at my previous student housing. We have had bug issues as well. We don't have keys, only hotel swipe keys which constantly get deactivated, i've been locked out at least 5 times now. They do have a nice gym and a nice pool. The clubhouse is nice expect none of the computers seem to work properly or have mouses. Printer doesn't connect with all the computers either. It's not terrible, but i wouldn't recommend unless you're willing to put up with inconveniences and terrible communication with the office.",2,2
"If I had the option to give this McDonalds half a star I would. I would actually put no stars. This is the WORST McDonald's in America. The food is always cold and your order is always incorrect. The only guarantee you'll get at this McDonalds is cold food, watered down soda, and an incorrect order. I've been here multiple times and at least one thing goes wrong. I actually now travel 15 mins down south to Green Valley where they offer AMAZING service and your food is 100% fresh and hot. It is made to order basically!!  They even gave my dogs pup cups like Starbucks. Love the Green Valley McDonalds. That manager should start managing the one in Sahuarita.",1,1
"It was disappointing. My sister in law recommended it so we came in for lunch. Half of the stuff we wanted to order was sold out. They just opened at 10am and we came in right at 12. It took forever for our food to come out. They didn't offer us any water, we had to ask for it. Our yellow noodle was tasteless. Maybe they ran out of the broth and just added water or something. My daughter's noodle was the same. My pho wasn't too bad though. My son liked his rice plate. I was debating between 2 and 3 stars but decided on 3. Maybe we caught them at a bad time, seeing it was just pass the holiday. Thought, not sure I will eat there again .",3,3
"I had mixed feeling about my experience at this place. I made a reservation and got there about 35 minutes early. They were very busy but I saw some tables open. Hostess scrambled a bit but sat us down earlier than my time and I appreciated that. Lots of options in that menu with what seemed to be rotating specials. I will tell you, the sushi is great and decently priced. Ambiance is of a higher scale/ big restaurant feel vs the other sushi spots Ive visited. We went from the ragoon, the fried rice (big portion), zen roll, red dragon, yellowtail sashimi, and the tuna sashimi sampler (toro was spectacular). Where I was not fond was the service and the sequence they brought my plates. Apps came in pieces, they forgot my miso soup and had to remind.  When the main courses came, again- with no sequence and in pieces, leaving breaks in between. The rolls for a portion of the table came last and delayed and once it got there the other half was done eating. I say great food and deserve 5 stars. But maybe an isolated bad night I walked in and got subpar service, maybe - so gave a three or less. I will try again but will be a while I will trek down. Food is really good but experience wise, not that good.",4,3
"I love this place!!  Homemade, delicious food, friendly people and great value.  We had the lunch special (spicy pulled pork sandwich, wonderful French Fries and a drink) all for $11.  The food was so good, we purchased a dozen homemade cookies.",5,5
"I would give them zero stars if it was an option.  Rude employees,  horrible customer service and mediocre Mani  and pedi.  Do yourself a favor and find another salon",1,1
"I cannot express how extremely picky I am about my eyelashes. Angelica is amazing! I have being going to her spa for over 4 years and I can tell you she is THE best,  I highly recommend her. The place itself is SUPER cute and Her staff is very friendly.

Kim's Cuban sandwich shop has been around for years! Make sure to stop by and enjoy a Cuban. Tip: call ahead if your in a hurry.,5,5
I was amazed. They were so fast with such a long line. I appreciate good customer service. This place was faster than any I have been in!,5,5
"All I can say is the Opryland is like being trapped in a Disneyland hell -- you are stuck there, there are lots of ""cute"" things to-do (but not really), there's bad restaurant offerings...  if you are thinking of staying here, you may like it if you like 1) taking a serious and then funny version of a group photo, 2) eating at the olive garden, 3) taking pictures of World's Largest XYZ on road trips. 

It's expensive, kitschy, and out of touch. It's huge, crowded, and more torturous than luxurious. 

The room we stayed in was decent, but we heard people in the hallway all the time (and also smelled their pot). 

Every time I hear ""Opryland,"" I throw up a little bit inside. Run far, far away.",2,1
"What a Fantastic stop this was. Me and my Girlfriend stopped in to check out the Newest Poke, Ramen spot in Center City. We were thoroughly impressed with everything. The Raman was tasty as Hell and so fulfilling. We also had a couple of Sushi donuts, both were Excellent. The staff was professional and courteous and very helpful with exploring the menu. My favorite was the Tokyo Fries which were on Special. 
 The restaurant and dining area were very clean. The kitchen looked very well kept also. The decor was very nice with some painted murals that were really cool. 
This was a very comfortable spot and we cant wait to go back.",5,5
"Mazzaro's ""used to be"" one of my favorite places to visit when I visit my parents several times a year in St. Pete, FL. My parents visit Mazzaro's weekly and have the same concern. The bread is great, best coffee ever (wish you could ship it out of state), wine & cheese selection is awesome. many good take out items as well. The bakery was my favorite bakery. Something has definitely changed since Nov. 2015. What happened to the Almond paste in the Almond Ring?  You ""used to"" sell this item for an unbelievably low price. I would rather pay more $$ to get the original recipe. It has no paste & no taste now. The Deli sandwich I have always enjoyed previous to 2016 was a great sandwich. Prices are going up every where. I would rather pay more & get your original full sandwich then the one I had in last visit while there in March & April 2016. If I wanted mostly bread- I could go to Subway. You had exceptional quality before- charge more & keep the original recipes.. This is an exceptional place- please bring back original recipes. Consider shipping coffee in the future. I bring home 2-3 pounds of coffee when I go back home to last me to my next visit.",3,3
"Hotel coffee, no way!!  So glad to find this cool coffee shop close to our hotel.  I love coffee and cycling so it was a no brainer to check out this hip coffee shop. The decor is super cool and I loved the vibe. The baristas were awesome and totally helpful & friendly. I hate pretentious hipster baristas-you don't get that here! 

My oat milk lavender latte was delicious and not sickly sweet-perfect! My son liked his mocha. I will definitely be back when we come to Nashville!",5,5
"I recently ate here with a small group (8). Unfortunately the service was not great. The server was not educated about the menu at all. After seeing octopus on to other restaurants menus, I decided to try the octopus. It was absolutely delicious. Others at my table had the shrimp (Gambas Al Ajillo/
Garlic Shrimp, Chorizo, Preserved Lemon, Shishito Peppers)  and said it was great.",4,4
First time here and it was great. We got the The Feast which isn't cheap but I think it's worth it. My wife and I had a great time on our anniversary. Our server Madison was friendly and  great. The food is as excellent. I would come again for sure! Definitely recommend!,4,5
"I decided to try Salted Chef after it was recommended by some of my friends. I have been using Hello Fresh, which we like, but you still have to prepare. I really wanted to try something that would already be prepared and ready for us to reheat. The chef came and worked independently. She was very professional. She made the three meals that I requested and left the receipt for the food she had purchased to make the meals. After a few hours, I had three delicious meals to enjoy with my family! I will definitely be using them again!",5,5
Catering at it's finest!  We used Daily Dish for our daughter's wedding in October 2017 and I've used them for corporate catering on several occasions. I could not be more pleased!  We had soooo many compliments on the food at the wedding! Wedding food is important :)  I also appreciated the professionalism and quick replies from Stephanie during the entire wedding planning process very much.,5,5
"I had the loveliest two nights here following my wedding on 9/22. The grounds are gorgeous, the room I stayed in was big, and clean, and we even had a little porch and hammock! Also, don't miss breakfast because it's delicious. BUT if you sleep in too late like I did, and let the owner know when you're checking out, he might just surprise you with two warm, delicious, freshly-baked muffins for your drive back to the real world. We will definitely be back!",5,5
"I was hesitant to book a room here after a previous negative experience at the neighboring Courtyard by Marriott Mount Laurel Cherry Hill. But I realize that not all Marriotts are created equal, even in the same town. So I took a chance with this one and I'm glad I did.

When it comes to hotels I always look for 3 minimum requirements for a satisfactory stay:

1. It's clean 
2. It's quiet
3. The staff is helpful and friendly

First and foremost, everything appeared to be clean from the common areas to the room itself. Now, I have to differentiate between clean and worn because the place is obviously older and could definitely use some updating. However, that doesn't necessarily translate to being unsanitary. Furthermore, all of the room's kitchen area components, including a cooktop, dishwasher, microwave and full size refrigerator were in working order.

Second on this list is the noise level. I only ask for a little peace and quiet during overnight hours. Therefore, I'm pleased to report that there was no problem in that regard. 

Finally, the staff provided exemplary customer service. The ladies at the front desk went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. If only every hotel had a staff like this one!

There was one positive and one negative outside of the basic requirements that are worth mentioning. Breakfast is included (yay!) but the pool was closed (boo!).",4,4
A covid friendly yummy fun place that I've been enjoying more throughout the pandemic! Can also bring your dog! Such a fun place and great service. Love the tamales and paella but I went with tacos this time. I've been many times and plan to keep going!,5,5
"This place is the gold standard for Quick Service (aka Fast Food) restaurants. They do just about everything right. Great food, great service (very fast) and they go above and beyond what you'd expect from a Quick Service Restaurant. Flowers on the tables, employees who actually smile, employees who will run out to your car in the rain with an umbrella, dining room staff that refills your drinks, takes your trash, and brings you sauces, napkins, etc. A restroom that looks like something out of a nice, Full Service restaurant. And did I mention the food? Fresh, hot, tasty! Best chicken strips, sandwiches, nuggets, and fries of ANYWHERE.
BTW, try this place for breakast. Their chicken biscuits are awesome!",5,5
"I'm not a sports fan or a better.  

But it's amazing how often I stumble into this spot. Years ago at a Yelp event we had a whiskey class here. We met the property Sommelier, and the education was on.  I discovered how a single drop of water could change the profile in a shot of whiskey.  How a scoop of vanilla gelato and Jeremiah Weed creates an adult root beer float that can kick your butt. 

My latest visit was for the Whiskey Hunt. Nice pairing!!  A couple of corned beef sliders that were so tender they just melted in your mouth, were paired with Jefferson's Ocean Kentucky Bourbon. This can easily be my ""winter whiskey"". I haven't discovered another one yet that can warm you from the inside out that fast.  Wow.  And Sean, huge kudos to him. As we sat down, checked in on Yelp, we discovered the Hunt special. I showed him my phone, he smiles and he instantly sets up two water bottles, two shots of the Ocean, leaves the bottle for pictures and places the slider orders. Sean is the man !!!

As a bonus for our night, we were able to watch the UNR homecoming game, the play offs to the World Series, and a boxing match. After all it's a sports bar, and there's no lacking a large screen to watch from any spot in the area.",4,5
If you like classic cars and a funky spot to explore check out the Stutz gallery. We asked a few people but went during a working day so we're able to find there car gallery by asking someone who works there. Otherwise it is a bit hard to navigate but just enter from the east side and head to the second floor. There is an art gallery with some fun and different art expressions to explore. And then there is the fun car exhibit! There are 14 cars ranging from pace cars to classics and it is amazing to see all the detail and craftsmanship. We plan to go back during a first Friday event to check out a lot of the artists. But it was fun to see the cars and explore a bit as a first visit.,5,5
"This hotel is only ok for me. The room was nice enough and the shower was amazing. Here are the issues I had:

1. There was no hair dryer in my room. When I went to ask the front desk person said it was there on the back of the bathroom door. It was not. He sighed and said he'd have one sent up. It came eventually. 
2. I never had any maid service over a three night stay. I saw a maid in the hallway and wanted to hand her my dirty towels and get clean ones. She said she didn't have enough and then walked away. 
3. The restaurant was seating people right next to each other when it was not crowded at all. They made no efforts to space people apart. When I asked to be moved, the person seemed reluctant to do so. She said ""there are 400 people in this hotel."" Ok sure but not all of them were in the restaurant at that time. 

I understand there are staffing issues everywhere, and I'm not even that mad about not having my room cleaned or the missing hair dryer - these things happen. I just wish the staff interactions I had were a little more professional and friendly. I did not feel like any of the staff were interested in helping me. I probably will not stay here again myself, but others might have a better experience.",3,3
"We arrived in Phlly from LHR.  Having to make a connecting flight we had to go through customs & back through security.  While getting through customs was straightforward, the rest of the process was anything but clear.  There was a lack of informative signage & staff to direct or answer questions. Now to the TSA experience: while I understand the the security procedures, the attitude of the TSA staffers was that of unhelpful, gestapo-like thugs. I don't expect them to be friendly, but they lack the ability to be decent humans when interacting with harried travelers. Coming through the scanner, a staffer was standing, blocking where I could go, staring at me. After a few seconds I asked where do I go, he just pointed the way w/o saying anything. It was creepy. TSA staffers barks out orders, brusquely answers your question as though I should have known the answer. I wonder if they take training classes on being rude, discourteous?  They have it down to an art form.",1,1
If I could give no stars I would. A package was overnighted  twice but never arrived no one to call very very frustrating. This was my paycheck and ups lost it twice. Very very disappointed will never ever use ups agin,1,1
Love love this salon! Very modern and chic. I had Jasmine do my hair for balayage and I loved it so much! I just showed her a picture I found on pinterest and it was exactly like it. Also as a new guest I received 20% off! She and everyone else there were very friendly and welcoming when I had my free consultation and also when I got my hair done. It was faster than I thought and they made sure I was happy with the end product before I left. Definitely recommend for any haircut/hairstyle you would like to get!,5,5
"Booked tire change at home. 
They did not disclose I have to find place to have TPMS reset. So more $$$.  Should have done at dealership where they do it all",2,2
"I would avoid this company. 

I recently purchased a home here in Oro Valley, and during the inspection numerous problems with the roof were identified. The inspector suggested that it was time to replace the 18 year old roof. The seller contacted Hallmark Roofing, (roofing contractor in Tucson, Arizona), who came out and more or less said ""The roof is fine, it just needs some maintenance and repairs"", and provided a low estimate for the service, which was then used to negotiate with me on. I spoke with Dan (the owner) of Hallmark Roofing, and he said he was quite confident the roof would give many more years of service after his repairs, and that he was so confident he'd extend a 2 year no-leak warranty to the entire roof, and not just his repairs. And given that his repairs included the peak of the roof, that actually amounts to about the same thing, but whatever. He was willing to stand behind his inspection report and his estimate of the repairs needed. That's good.   

So I got this relatively small amount of money as a negotiation concession for the condition of the roof (did I mention there was evidence of leaking inside the house?), we bought the house, and I called Hallmark in to make the repairs. 

They sent a youngish guy out to size-up the project, (I got the feeling he was a subcontractor and not an employee of Hallmark Roofing of Tucson Arizona), and he immediately ran around and reset of few slipped tiles. Good start. Came back a few days later with mortar, silicone sealant and made several more repairs. Said he ran out of mortar and would return the next day (today), which he did. Nice young guy, but he did miss a few areas that were obvious from standing on the ground, and one entire small section of the roof altogether. OK, no biggie, I did catch them before he left, and he did the work, and it seems fine. But not what I would call confidence-inspiring. 

Today it's time to pay Hallmark Roofing (Roofing contractor in Tucson, Arizona)  and lo and behold, the warranty statement only references the areas repaired. Not what we discussed. I contacted Hallmark and they then offered to warranty the entire roof for an additional fee. Um, no, that's not what Dan offered. We go back and forth, they stand firm - you want a whole-roof warranty, you pay more. Not cool - it's the old 'bait and switch'. 

 I definitely won't do business with or recommend a company that can't be trusted to keep their word, and changes their tune, and I don't think you should either. 

Life is too short to work with people  you can't trust. You can't trust Hallmark Roofing of Tucson AZ. If you are looking for a roofing contractor in Tucson or Oro Valley Arizona, Hallmark Roofing is not a good choice.",1,1
The service was fast and the staff was really nice! I thought the pasta was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the vegan meatballs. I got the spinach fettuccine w pesto.,4,4

Having them deliver to my house is dangerous...ly convenient.

Note that the flavors rotate every week, which gives you a reason to check the app and discern, ""Am I having cookies delivered again?""  I say try it at least once.",4,5
Food was great and service was excellent from Jeson! Will definitely come back again.,4,5
"This was the first time I had been back to India Palace in a few years. I must say I was extremely disappointed. I was not give the complimentary appetizers to begin, nor was I greeted in a friendly or timely manner. The restaurant was not crowded at all and it took nearly an hour to prepare my food. After a while, I decided to just cancel the order. They assured me it was coming out and I shared that I had yo go but would take carry out instead. When I got home, the brown bag was soaked because they did not secure the top on my curry and it spilled out. I am also pretty sure that it wasn't curry but some type of soup instead. I will not be back.",1,1
"I was referred to David E. Callahan Pool Plastering by Aquavita Pools.  I feared that I may need to have my pool plaster re-done.  I invited this company out to look at my pool to see what needed to be done to it as it s 16 years old.
I worked with a lovely woman named Anna to set the appointment for them to evaluate the pool.  She had a great attitude and willingly played phone tag with me until we could speak and set up the inspection appointment which happened the next day.  Anna even called me on the day of the appointment to give me Gerorge's most up to date time of arrival which was very accurate.
George inspected my pool and told me that my plaster was a 7 of 10 and that I did not need to replace it - keep in mind that I called them to request a replacement of the plaster!  
George was very pleasant and I found him to be earnest &r helpful and he seems to enjoy his job and is very honest.
He could have easily  :""sold"" me on re-doing the plaster in the pool but instead upon inspection of the pool he went to his truck and got a special sponge and taped it to a pole and showed me that I could eliminate the stains that made me think I had to replace the gunite.  He also tooko  the time to offer me further advice as to what I could do to repair my pool issues on my own so as to not have to make an un-needed investment in his services.  WHO DOES THAT TODAY?!?!
i'm writing this review and telling everyone I know that has a pool that they should have this company come out to evaluate their pool in the event that they think that they need work done because I found this company to be VERY HONEST & TRUSTWORTHY.
I will look forward to working with this company in the future and you should feel comfortable doing the same.
Best!

What an adorable coffee shop! I spent a lovely hour there last weekend working while waiting for a swim meet to start. I had a perfectly brewed dark roast and a breakfast sandwich. Prices were good and both the coffee and food were delicious. I was sad the next day (Sunday) when I returned and discovered they aren't open on Sundays.,4,5
"I don't even drink that much coffee, but the coffee here is super smooth, never bitter or sour. It's the sort of coffee that warms you up from the inside out especially on a cold day. Seating is a bit hard to find as it's in a trendy Rittenhouse location though, so be prepared to wait or take your coffee to go. Oh, and there's no menu posted (it's not a Starbucks!). :)",4,5
Outstanding body and paint work. They get done when promised. The work they do is reasonably priced and very friendly service. Would not take my car anyplace else.,5,5
"Got ignored at customer service twice. Stood in line and moved up when I was supposed to, followed by another lady, who got helped before I did. Absolutely absurd. Called to complain and they blame it on the busy day and renovation. You guys really didn't see me standing in line that whole time, and didn't see me standing in front of the counter? As a loyal target customer, I'm extremely disappointed.",1,1
"My boyfriend and I discovered this restaurant through a Living Social deal, and it is now the main restaurant we visit when we make a trip down to Reno.

The owner is a lovely woman - friendly and attentive.  The food is served quickly (we order from the Vegetarian section) - we generally order a lentil or split pea dish with a vegetable dish.  It is served with a basket of the traditional Injera (which you use pieces of to scoop up the food - I find this fun!)  The meal comes served on a large platter covered with a large round of Injera, and a light salad that a perfect accompaniment to the flavors of the dishes.  Two entrees with the injera and side salad is enough for both of us.

Good to note that they are closed Mondays, between 3-5p Tues-Sat, and closed for dinner Sunday.  For more details:  http://www.zagolofreno.com",5,5
"Just had Hello Sunshine for lunch with my Co- Workers , we did a pick up order , food was ready fast , location was clean , and the food was absolutely amazing! We will be ordering often hoping they start delivering because this would be great to have at the office for lunch or at home for dinner , It is a breath of fresh air to have a healthy choice rather than all the italian and chinese food ! Loved it !",5,5
Great breakfast. Love the cozy feel of the place and the location. Coffee could be stronger but if had a good flavor.,4,4
"Came here on a Wednesday night. Chill spot, low key. Nice ambience, good for dates. After dinner drink, etc. They have really good sours that I've never tried before. Overall, really enjoyed it! Nicole & Shaun were attentive. Thanks Nicole for serving us!",4,5
"I gave the place 2 chances. The first time I ordered spaghetti with mussels. I received spaghetti covered in olive oil and NO MUSSELS! They comped my meal which was nice, but still disappointing. The second time I went, we ordered a few pizza pies. We asked the waitress to slice it for us and she replied, ""No if I cut it, the pizza will get soggy"". That frustrated our whole table. That atmosphere is great, service is horrible, food is not so good.",1,2
"Pizza was very good, not cheap, but very good!  The dough was the big winner.  Nice crust with a pillowy chew.  The ingredients were quality and service was quite speedy.  If you haven't had it yet I highly recommend giving it a try!",4,5
"Beautiful restaurant, great drink menu, and the food was pretty good. Our server clearly couldn't wait to get our group of 5 women out of there though. Cleared our food and drinks before they were even gone. Never asked if we wanted another round of drinks. Put a damper on a night out with girlfriends I hadn't seen in a while. Wouldn't really recommend this place for that reason.",3,3
"We sat outside with friends for lunch this past weekend (dinner plates aren't served until 4). The lamb hummus was excellent! Homemade pita is included but they should add a few extra for the amount of hummus provided. 
The grain salad was amazing and I didn't expect to like it more than the shwarma wrap we got. By mistake they dropped a burrata bowl so we each got to try it. Oh wow! The flavors of the sauce and the bread that accompanied were incredible.",4,5
I went to Sun Tan City today to get a a spray tan and this lovely lady named Courtney assisted me.  She was very sweet and helpful and I had a great experience!,5,5
"We had the best time learning to cook with Mike and Yoon! We learned so much and all of the food was delicious! We can't wait to use our tips to make dumplings, scallion pancakes and bulgogi in the future. Highly recommend taking an in-home class with them!",5,5
You never see the true face of a gym before you leave it. I regret joining this gym. Don't join if there is ever a slight possibility that you may leave the area within your contracted period. You'll pay $150 to quit.,1,1
"Took a party of 4 today for lunch. After a 5 minute wait at the door, no one was there to greet my party, they finally sat us at a booth in the bar area. 10 minutes later we left. No one greeted us, plenty saw us. No manager around. I stuck my head in the kitchen on the way out and said we are leaving. The restaurant was dirty, not crowded, and now less profitable. We went to a longhorn close by and lunch was great. Bye bye Logan's.",1,1
"Went for their Taco Tuesday day. Like mentioned in previous reviews their tacos are small and at full price would be way overpriced. The tacos tasted good. However they messed up my order so not sure which was which but what I assume was the shredded beef tacos had a good flavor. The other I assume was the Al Pastor was just OK at best. Didn't have much flavor at all, with tough pieces of meet (gristle). The tap beer was Luke warm. It was nice that they had a chip and salsa bar, but two of the salsas were empty. The cleanliness inside and out could also use a little more attention. Overall it was an OK visit. I might go back again, but only on a taco Tuesday as their regular price for their tacos is way over priced.",3,3
So happy I went to Paw Palace to get my yorkipoo.  I got her last November and I couldn't be happier.  I happened to be in Arizona when I decided to look for a puppy and I would travel there from California again to get a puppy from Paw Palace.  Very responsive and patient with my questions.  Great experience.,5,5

"missing half my order. and as for the cookie I got you would be cited during a health inspection for your exhaust and the poorly dated chocolate chip cookies dated ""8"" 8 what? 8am?pm? september 8? october 8?! come on lol it's literally already being done do the entire date please.",2,1
"We had booked this venue for our ""Sangeet"" night as a traditional Indian dance event that happens for the day before the wedding. I honestly cannot speak more highly of a venue in the Tampa Bay area. I wanted a venue that was chic, in a nice location of town, and something that would wow our guests. 

The team recently put in a lot of effort to renovate the space, which includes beautiful tile floors in place of where carpet use to be on the sides of the venue and other beautiful features. Another unique feature of this venue is the bank vault located in the back of the venue, as it is an old converted bank. This is a great place for a photo opportunity for guests or even a place to put a photo booth up. 

Besides the absolutely stunning venue, the real highlight of this place is the team you would work with to have your dream event. Morgan, the event manager, has taken so much of her personal time to make sure every question that we had was answered and met us in person whenever necessary to make sure we were comfortable with the layout. The team at this venue will put their heart into ensuring that you have the event you have dreamed of. Don't hesitate to use this venue for your next event, its spectacular!",5,5
"Very busy restaurant, so please know that going in. Good food, prices a tad high for the normal breakfast meals. My server Donald was very pleasant and even thou running crazy around was able to stop and communicate with me, I understand being super busy so if you communicate that you'll be there in a min, I'm sorry I'm gonna run this food I'll be right come back (I'd rather someone get their food hot then not).. those are all acceptable communications when going to a restaurant, specially a busy brunch spot. 
Now to the food, mediocre. The banana crunch pancake was good, golden crisp. I really liked that! I also really liked I had the option to only get one. I stayed pretty basic to try it out and got the egg cheese on toast with added bacon, it was just that, nothing wrong with it nothing special. The apple stuffed French toast looked good but did not get anything with it so I leaned away for more on my plate than one item. I may return but not rushing too.",4,3
"I was just about to add an extra star . . . until I saw LC's incredibly unprofessional response to my brother's (Peter R.) honest review. After posting his review the owners private messaged my brother in an extremely defensive and insulting fashion, slamming his manners, accusing him of lying, and dogging how we were raised. Are you kidding me? I am all about supporting small business but NOT when the business can't take constructive feedback with grace. That being said . . . 

We were really excited to get some ""home"" (we're Vietnamese) food to balance out the heavy cuisine we'd been indulging in the past couple of days. We walked in during the late afternoon and there were maybe 10 other people dining in a place that has a capacity for about 50 people. We were greeted and invited to take a seat at a long table. After taking off our coats and sitting down we were quickly asked to scoot over ""because of the lunch rush."" We raised our eyebrows at that but, ok, whatever Uncle. We proceeded to order phó dac biêt (combo), bún cha (grilled pork), an order each of summer rolls and spring rolls, chrysanthemum tea, and thai iced tea. 

We first received the summer and egg rolls. I found the egg rolls a little grainy and greasier than I'd prefer, but the filling was satisfyingly meaty with good flavor; I HATE egg rolls made with cabbage as filler. I liked the summer rolls better, though the peanut sauce was blander than I prefer. I was pumped to get my bún bowl - loaded with real romaine lettuce and other veggies and plenty of grilled pork like my momma makes. My brother was about to eagerly dive into his phó . . . until we noticed a black hair on the sliced beef. NOOOOO! Please note: bro's hair is shaved short and my ponytailed head is covered with a do-rag and sitting across the table. Wuddn't us.

Not wanting to make a scene we waited for Aunty to come by and showed her the hair. She wordlessly took the bowl, scrutinized it as if it wasn't as plain as day, and walked away with it without saying a word to either of us. Uncle soon came out to offer apologies and ask if my brother wanted a new fresh bowl. Yes, please. Then Aunty came out to assure us that a fresh new bowl was coming out. Making amends, awesome. We were still a little skeeved out but not going to make a scene or be disrespectful to our elders. A fresh bowl of phó came out and our meal resumed. I could tell the broth had good, solid structure but was unfortunately diluted. My brother was also disappointed there weren't more noodles and thought it was lacking in meat, especially for dac biét. 

My initial rating was two stars. According to the rubric, that translates into ""Meh. I've experienced better."" Lilly's was far from horrible but honestly, I've had better. What knocks it down to one star was the horrible response to my brother's review. As a business that relies on reviews you should take each seriously. If you choose to respond, do it professionally. Otherwise, rely on your good reputation to balance out the negative reviews.",1,1
"Delicious Thai food.   Everything that I have tried so far has been 100% delicious so I assume everything on the menu is good.   I am a huge fan of the Panang Curry and the summer rolls.  I've tried the curry with both chicken and tilapia and both are really good.    My partner who isn't much of a Thai food fan even enjoys the different things he has tried over the three times we've gotten food.    Because of COVID, we have only tried takeout but I do look forward to trying a sit down experience in the future.",5,5
"I got three pounds of crawfish and it was AMAZING. Had us waiting outside until they opened amazing. The flavor and spice level were perfect!!

It was a small place so everything came out fast and I appreciate that. The drinks were just okay to me. I had a peach daiquiri.

Def recommend going to this place if you're looking for fresh good seafood at a sit down!",4,5
"I got the Super Poke bowl and it was delicious! It was stuffed with tuna, salmon, and crab with delicious cabbage, lettuce, and edamame to add a deliciously fresh crunch. Finally the seaweed salad and pickled ginger added a great tangy/sweet contrast. Overall, very delicious and filling bowl. The only way to make this bowl better would be a vinegary rice like in a chirashi. That would elevate the whole bowl, in my opinion.",4,5
This place rocks!!!! The best! They have the best meals to go and a wonderful selection .,5,5
"This place is absolutely awesome. Great delivery and great service. I even ordered a pizza one day, requesting certain toppings on it, and Simone called me back and suggested trying a different combination, and they where 100 percent on point with it. Delivery always arrives faster then the estimated time, and there delivery guys/gals are always smiling and greeting you. Highly suggest to anyone in our area.",5,5
Place is kind of run down. Lots of repairs needed. Staff was friendly. Food was ok. I doubt I will return anytime soon,2,2
"I've had nothing but good experiences with my sons therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists here. The facility has supported me every step of the way from intake thru his current supports. His therapists are always available for help should I have questions and the doctors have supported him throughout the two years since intake. Thank you to everyone here, you have all made everything a lot easier after his diagnosis.",5,5
"I bought my 2005 elsewhere, but started using Pellegrino service department because it was closer to where I live. I have been very impressed with the service department so the natural first stop when it came to buy my next used Malibu  was Pellegrino. I was very happy with the total purchasing experience from beginning to end. Our sales consultant, Raffaele was outstanding. He was patient, knowledgeable, friendly and professional. He took the time to show us at least a dozen cars and then accompany us on our test drive. He was THE instrumental factor in us purchasing our Malibu at Pellegrino. We really liked the no-pressure policy at Pellegrino as evidenced by Raffaele and the sales manager, Brian. I think we got a super deal on the vehicle and when we picked it up, Raffaele spent a lot of time explaining all the features, especially the MyLink System, Onstar, and Bluetooth. We promptly received all necessary documentation and our extra key fob. Many dealers make purchasing a new car such a hassle with stress, but at Pellegrino it was a pleasurable and fun experience!",5,5
"All visitors and locals of Nashville alike must come to Moto! The industrial-chic space in the Gulch serves splendid Haute Italian fare. 

For starters, we split a Margherita pizza and sausage with honey pizza. Now, as a pizza connoisseur with family members from NY, this was up there in terms of palatable fare. Also had a Yazoo Pale Ale, because this is Nashville after all, and it's important to drink local beer. 

Where this restaurant really shines is its homemade pasta dishes. A couple of us ordered the campanelle with chiles, peas, and fennel sausage. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had, and I'm saying this as someone who has been to Italy twice. 

Our waiter was awesome, our drinks were always refilled, and I didn't feel any upselling techniques like many restaurants encourage nowadays.",5,5
"I love coming to Nail Story! Best experience in the area and they have OPI dipping powder which is my favorite and hard to find. They always do a great job, are very professional, and I've left very happy with many great long-lasting mani/pedis.
They are taking COVID precautions with temp screenings, hand washing, masks required, and plastic barriers so it feels very clean and safe.
I've had different technicians and all have completed their jobs with care - going so far as to help me match a color to a dress for a wedding! Excellent service that I can't recommend enough.",5,5
"Wanted to try some New Mexican food so we got take out from here and had a terrible experience! When we called to place the order the hostess was very unwelcoming on the phone and had a hard time answering our questions. Then when we get there we find out that it was $20 per burrito and they were completely basic burritos. Nothing special! In fact most of the items that the hostess had told us was in the burrito, in fact did not come with it. And to top it all off, she neglected to tell us that burrito was extremely spicy! Horrible experience and do not plan on ever going back!",1,1
"We stopped in Philadelphia and had to try a good Philly cheesesteak. We chose to go to Mac's Tavern. It was in a very good location. It was a few blocks from independence hall and the liberty bell. The atmosphere was a cozy casual bar atmosphere. There were families there in booths but we chose to sit at the bar for quick service! The women's bathroom was very dark which was interesting.. Our bartender was very nice and informative of what were the best sellers on the menu. 
We ordered their top two best sellers which were the bourbonic steak sandwich and the triple threat burger. The bourbonic steak sandwich was very good! It was essentially a Philly cheese steak with mushrooms and a few other yummy things. The triple threat burger was also very good! It contained bacon, barbecue, and gooey cheese. Both sandwiches came with fries and their house aioli which was delicious.",4,5
"Quality Plumbing Pros recently installed a new water heater for my house. Aaron, the owner, was fantastic. He provided a prompt estimate which was more competitive than the two others I received. He kindly answered all my questions. He arrived right on time and  did a great job with the installation. We couldn't be happier with his work. It's great to know we have a go-to local plumber for any of our future needs.",5,5
Just came here for drinks but had a great time! Our waitress was very informative and offered great suggestions after discussing our tastes. Hope to be back one day!,5,5
"Before you get to the full review, I'm just gonna say: hire this company. Hands down one of the smoothest and meticulous moving companies I've worked with. 

Once a person puts their home on the real estate market, your mailbox is going to be flooded with adverts for moving companies... it's overwhelming to say the least. That being said we asked our realtor for suggestions and she recommended Big Mans Moving Company. We called and got a friendly greeting and then they immediately started walking us through the quote process and I'm gonna stop here: you would not believe how thorough and helpful they were!! I mean the employee on the phone pretty much knew (by the size of our house and living situation) exactly how many boxes we would have, the size of truck the movers would need, how many moving blankets were needed and about how many hours it was going to take. 

So we paid a deposit, and started packing! 

The night before moving day they emailed us an ETA and the next morning the movers were right on time. 

When they arrived they introduced themselves (Jared, Blaine, and Ryan) and did a walk through with us to know exactly what was going and what items were staying. And then they just kicked it into high gear! They communicated well with each other, they had great attitudes, and overall just made us as customers feel taken care of; which is rare these days. 

Even when we didn't have enough moving blankets, they found solutions. And on that note: when they recommend that you buy 60 moving blankets... BUY 60 MOVING BLANKETS haha. If you care about at all about your earthly possessions that you've spent time, money, and effort earning those, then buy some moving blankets to protect your stuff. Amazon has 'em pretty cheap at pretty affordable rates! I just wish we bought more! 

Once they got everything loaded up from our 3bed 2 bath house (about 50 boxes plus all the furniture), they took it to our storage unit and unloaded it all neatly and efficiently! All within 3 hours!!! 

Can't say enough good things about this company. Jared, Blaine and Ryan did awesome :)",5,5
"This is a great place. I've had a chicken salad, which is like a sweet tasting slightly pickled cabbage and carrots mixed with chicken. Doesn't sound like much but it's fire. Their spring rolls dipped in the hoisin/peanut butter sauce are also delicious. My boyfriend's pho was delicious, nice and flavorful. I had a pho with a pork broth so it wasn't as flavorful but the ingredients were quality. I've had their pad Thai, which I honestly just didn't care for. It's not as sweet as it should be in my opinion. My boyfriend did like it tho. We've also had their Thai iced tea and they are also delicious. I think a little more coconut milk could be added to the tea, but that wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. Very friendly service as well.",4,5
"Love this place, the people and the atmosphere! Family friendly with amazing croissant sandwiches!",5,5
Had a great morning here picking very tasty and fresh blueberries. We had so much fun. Friendly staff and great pricing! Thank you!,5,5
I have no idea how people are giving this place 5 stars. I go to take a bite of the chicken tender sandwich and it was absolutely terrible. It was way over cooked and it was cold. And of course that made the chicken dry and rubbery. The fries were cold too. Not sure how this place stays open. Don't waste your money here.,1,1
"This Country Inn & Suites is the best in the Tucson area.  Yes, you will be a little further out from all the Tucson attractions but the staff are nicer here.  The pool area is much larger than that of Country Inn at Tucson city center.

Plus, Country Inn & Suites has the old country charm and decorum to it.  The city center location has the newer upscale look to it.  I am old school and I will also choose the airport location whenever I am in Tucson.",5,5
"Xtreme Tacos is Xtremely awesome!  The staff is super friendly here and I  love love love their tacos.  I also like coming here because you can get yelp cash back and they do call ahead takeout.  The restaurant itself is clean.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating here.  They also have a Nintendo in the back of the indoor seating area which I have played a few times while waiting for my food.       

When it comes to the tacos, you choose from their various types of meat and then you pick the style of taco that you want.  They have three different styles, Tijuana, Xtreme and Buffalo.  I have tried them and all while the Buffalo style is good, its not really my favorite.  In my opinion, the Tijuana and Xtreme style tacos are where it is at.  My favorite taco combination is fried or grilled grouper Tijuana style.  The Tijuana style is simple and fresh which really lets the grouper shine.  I like the Xtreme style taco with Carnitas or Carne Asada.  I have tried a lot of the meats here though and they have all been seasoned and cooked well.  They have a few different homemade salsas of varying spice level to put on your tacos as well.  Two or three tacos is pretty filling for me here.  

I should also note that the chips here are awesome.  They are made fresh in house.  I will order a side and chips and guac to go with my tacos if I am feeling particularly hungry.",4,5
I had a wonderful manicure at Sophia's.  Per COVID appointments are required and even though I was late they were very accommodating.  They said a great job on my nails and were friendly.  Definitely going back!,5,5
I just got an eyelash lift and tint for the first time with Amanda and it was amazing! I was a little nervous going in but the overall experience was very calming and a relaxing part of my day :) the prices were great and the results were amazing !,5,5

"Lovely atmosphere. Good service. Decent food. Daughter liked her steak so much I wasn't given a taste. I ate something vegetarian, which was probably a dumb move , given the name. Will certainly go back.",3,4
"Couldn't help it but to come here like 3 times during my visit to New Orleans. The chicken is absolutely delicious. It is juicy, comes out piping hot and has great seasoning to it. It's probably some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The biscuit is ok.. I think Popeyes might have them beat by a little bit on the biscuits. The fries are crispy and seasoned well with a nice subtle crunch. The staff that was there were pretty nice, this location is not in the best area ever - seems to be a lot of bums hanging outside but I guess should be relatively safe to visit during the day. 

I hope willies expands and opens up in other states as their chicken truly is awesome. Only feedback I have for this place is that it could be cleaner. The tables and floors out back are really sticky.",4,4
"When it comes to Florida and craft beer, we know people is talking about sweet, tasty, and flavorful beer. However, when you talk about Angry Chair, you talk about sweet lord diabetus.

Every time I go to Tampa I make sure I stop by Angry Chair and enjoy their beers. This past weekend I was lucky enough to be able to get tickets to their 3rd anniversary party, and let me tell you something what an event this was! The event started at 5:30, but they by 5 o'clock the started checking in people, and by 5:20 everybody was inside ready to begin the party.

I first went for what has been their more after sought beer Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake, this beer is just dreaming, second I had what I would say ir was the winner of the night, their Barrel Aged Rocky Road, this beer is like breakfast in a cup.

This is by far one of the best breweries in Florida and they put together the best beer fest I've been to this year. 

Ryan and his team are the best and this place is definitely worth to check out even if you are not into craft beer.

Thanks again to such amazing event, and cheers to many more years to Angry Chair!",5,5
"One of my biggest complaints about Tiffin is that although the food is so delicious, it is a little difficult to drop $30 on two entrees and naan when you're not super-crazy hungry.  The other issue is when you're by yourself and you just want a little, not two huge servings of Indian cuisine.  

To the rescue?  Tiffin*etc.  Here they serve smaller, individually portioned servings of some damn fine indian food that you seriously can't find elsewhere.  

The girlfriend and I had a individual pizza each but it was waaaay too much food when one could have held both of us over with our other dish, a Kati-Roll with potato in it, split between us.  The pizza was, as my girlfriend put it, like an indian dish's meat placed on a piece of naan.  You don't get the rice or the sauce but the quick essence of the dish is still there and it's still very delicious.  

The Kati-Roll was something entirely differently.  When it arrived to our table, I was expecting something small in a plain tortilla but it was something else, something further.  The wrap was crispy but soft on the inside and the roll was accompanied with an egg on the inside.  It was seriously delicious and led me to believe that although the dishes are $5, they are not lacking in quality.  

I have to say that the entire experience was really, really great.  It's as if it's a Tiffin-lite scenario.  You want delicious indian food but you don't want to go crazy with it or you want to keep it light.  What a great idea!",5,5
"This is a great location to rent a car.  It is not as speedy and efficient as an airport, put they make up for it by being extra friendly.",5,4
"The Edmonton Spence Diamonds makes me want to never recommend this company to anyone ever. Me and my fiance had the most HORRIBLE experience.

First off my fiance went to put a deposit down on a diamond that was at another store. The guy who was helping him was, Chris. He NEVER called the store to find out if they diamond was still even there and just took the deposit from my fiance. 

Then, 4 hours later, my fiance gets a call saying oh hey sorry but we sold your diamond to someone else. After taking with Chris, he lied to us about what happened because after talking with the Manager, there seemed to be a different story.

Then Spence did NOTHING to help us out because of their screw up. Chris even NEVER apologized. They DID NOT admit to making a mistake and THEN tried to up sell us into buying a more expensive diamond which THEY KNEW was NOT in our price range. 

They were not helpful at all, worst experience ever and would NEVER recommend to anyone. We actually got a way nicer diamond then Spence could ever offer at a way cheap price then Spence from a Wholesaler. And then got the ring custom made from a really amazing jeweler. And it ended up being WAY cheaper then through Spence.

Honestly, all they care about is MONEY.",1,1
This has to be the worst apartments in Tampa. They show you a nice clean model and then after you sign the lease they give you the exact opposite and then when you leave they bill you for expenses that were there before! The workers can even stand being there. They changed me over 200 in miscellaneous things and sent me to collections without ever notifying me of any of this! I've lived in various apartments in the area and this is absolutely the worst!  You might save a few dollars on rent but you will pay for it in other ways! If you sign a lease here you will remember this post and wish you listened!,1,1

"I used to hit Teavana for tea a few times a year when I lived in the area, but since moving to Center City 4 years ago I mostly stick with closer options. I happened to be back in KOP for shopping last week and decided to restock on tea. I remembered that Teavana had a delicious rooibos chai blend and that I'd also enjoyed the components separately, so I decided to see if I could get the same. 

I walked in and, instead of looking at the menu, told them I'd like a rooibos, a chai, and their rooibos chai blend. I got confused stares. I tried again. I mean, I know those are general categories of tea, but I am absolutely sure that rooibos and chai are types of tea any tea purveyor should know. I hedged. ""Maybe you don't make that blend anymore?"" A woman down the counter looked at me and said ""we haven't sold a plain rooibos tea on its own for like four years."" Well, lady, I haven't been to your store in 4 years so that would explain that. And thanks for the snooty attitude. 

Turns out they didn't have a plain chai, either. They did still have the rooibos chai blend (... which leads me to wonder why the hell they can't get the components separately?) so I ordered 2 oz. The girl who was helping me poured 6 oz. into a baggie, weighed it, poured some out, weighed it again, and asked me if 3 oz. would be OK.  Really? You are too damn lazy to pour a single ounce of tea out of a baggie and into a large open-mouthed container?

The tea is wonderful, but the attitude left a bitter taste in my mouth.",2,2
"The Fountain on Locust is known for its soups and for its ice cream. I am starting to become a regular for lunch, going at least once every two weeks. The portions are right on target for lunch. I don't think I have had a bad soup, and the Stutz salad with its spinach, mandarin oranges, walnuts and goat cheese is pure yumminess. I've tried the fig and bacon flat, the pesto chicken open-faced sandwich, and the egg salad sandwich (called the High Hat), and honestly, I could order any of them again and be happy. Next I need to go AFTER work so I can work my way down their list of ice cream martinis!",5,5
"Repairs... Repairs... Repairs... 
I mean, no one wants to schedule an appointment for a repair, especially when it deals with the AC blower motor in the middle of summer!
However, I have to say I called in on Saturday, got an appointment for early Monday morning.
Showed up a little early so I could wait for the shuttle... 
It ended up taking a lot longer than expected so I checked in again and we decided to drive my car back to my house and he drove it back to the shop. Extra gas, but at least I was home in time for my job. Whatever works I guess!
I think it only took a couple hours before they called me with the update.
They didn't check in about fixing it first, I believe it's because the diagnostics are $169, and so they basically put that towards the repairs and I didn't end up owing more than that.
AC back up and running perfectly, great!
They picked me up and drove me back to pick up my car and all was as I expected it to be.
Overall good experience.  Thanks, Todd!

Also, I have to say this was my first experience at DW Honda.
We purchased our CRV through the Buick side next door, and they have been great with service, the purchase, etc.",5,4
"There are few times when a restaurant's service, meal, boss, and ambience are up to par with my expectations. We ordered the garlic chicken which was absolutely phenomenal, the chicken was fresh. We also ordered the dry pepper fish which was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the salt and pepper shrimp which was just as good. Mark (the owner) personally introduced himself to us and he was so kind, Try the peanut butter gelato dessert! Absolutely life changing.",5,5
"This place was great! My family loves the dim sum and everything we ordered was delicious! They accommodated our large party on a busy weekend without any issues and provided friendly, attentive service!",4,5
"Can't not say enough about Los Jefes! Freshest, and tastiest mexican. While the food is absolutely fabulous(don't forget to end your meal with churros&ice cream), the owners and staff are so generous too! They donated burritos and chips with all the dips to our Ochsner Lab! Everyone raved about the huge portions, and great quality. Especially the guacamole So make sure to repay them for their kindness, like we most certainly will, and have a margarita while you are at it!",5,5
"Awesome beer, great staff and a cool hangout this Texan loved. The owner is a great guy and I told him about my favorite beer in Texas and he showed me something from the back- absolutely amazing, just as amazing! I'll be back when I do the Mini again next year!",5,5
"This review is long overdue. I love brunch at Horn's eatery and so do many others based on how long the wait can get on a weekend. The wait can get a little long, I think we waited for 30-40 minutes on a Saturday around 11 AM but once we were seated the service was fairly quick and food came out in a timely manner. It's definitely worth the wait though. My boyfriend and I brought our dog and sat outside and the staff were super friendly. They brought our dog water and pieces of bacon for him to snack on. I highly recommend getting the oyster Benedict. You won't regret it. They are also very generous with their portion sizes. Their Bloody Mary had a nice kick to it. 5 stars!",5,5
"This was my very first time taking a spin class... whew! It is a workout, but I really enjoyed it. Adrianna was amazing! I can't wait to go back. Her playlist was really good, the music was really loud and motivating. 

They supply you with shoes, towels, water and a locker to put your things in. You can even order a smoothie type drink to be waiting on you when you're done with the class. 

The shoes are cool, they stick right into the bike so that your feet don't slip during all the pedaling. Again my first time ever taking a spin cycle and I WILL be back!

Definitely feel like I got a full body workout!",5,5
"Stayed here 2 years ago and was extremely satisfied.  Fast-forward to last week and it was a total disappointment.  The rooms are not maintained or cleaned.  Stains on furniture and carpets, dishes and silverware were filthy and wound up moving rooms due to ants and a blocked up kitchen sink that they could not repair.  Both rooms had broken toilet seats. As a Hilton Honors member, I was shocked and disappointed. Don't waste your money here.",1,1
"I'm from California, and these are some of the best tacos I've ever had!  You can't beat the flavor and the 2 guys that run it are badass.  Skip the imitators, get the real deal.",5,5
"Again, do not expect good service or a fancy, spotless restaurant. u go here for the food only. not the service, not the ambiance. the fact that its very cheap is just icing on the cake. don't forget to order a guava/cheese empanada for dessert. i only go here either extremely early in the AM or at off-peak hours. that way i get decent service. calling ahead by phone only works if u call at off-peak hours as well. this place is small and mobbed most of the time. thus the lack of service.",4,3
"My father's business is located a mile or so up the road and we have shared Father-daughter breakfasts and lunches at the Breadboard since I was little girl. I am not sure how they do it, but even during lunch hours when the line often leads out the door, the floors of this place are immaculate. From the countertops to the deli slicer, the level of upkeep is well, refreshing.  In the recent 5 years, I believe since a change of ownership, this town staple has stepped up their game. From actual decor to their menu, they are now a modern version (the salad bar upgrades speak volumes to this) to an old classic.

Copying what I believe is the Starbuck's mantra, the board in front says it all. If they don't get it right the first time, tell them and they will do it again. After reading the comments about the bread used, I couldn't help but laugh at the irony that the choice of bread is exactly why the BreadBoard received attention and complimentary write ups in the first place. To each his own, but there is just no debating the quality of everything served here.  For any business but especially a small business, the measures in place to keep customers happy is impressive.
 
I can't write about the Breadboard without mentioning the contagious ""Cheers"" vibe. If they don't know your name yet, they will very soon. Yes, the staff is friendly but truthfully, I find how perceptive they are to be what is most notable. They keep the line moving, getting those who need to be out the door quickly and humorously checking in with those who don't. 

 And, though somewhat irrelevant, the owner is a hardworking friendly guy whose staff seems to adore him but who also seems to have quite the lady fan base in town....",5,5
"Love this place.

It's right down the block from where I live and the soup is fantastic.

By far better than something you can get at a Panera or some other type of Soup/Salad chain.

Now this menu is pretty good for a place of this size. I think about 8-10 soup options as well as some 3-4 salad options.

Also there are some bakery items that seem pretty good. Coffee cake, Muffins, Pumpkin Spice breads....  

Give this place a look if you're just heading out of the office for a quick bite or just need a quick fix of warmth on these blustery days in Indy.

Definitely worth a shot...  

Oh and most importantly the price is right!",5,5
"This restaurant is incredible. Tacos are awesome, atmosphere is interesting, Troy the owner is gnarly, an most of the employees are helpful. MOST. My only complaint is this one manager. I don't know his name, let's call him douchenozzle in a red hat. After waiting a half hour for one of my fellow diners to get her sandwich (some pulled pork, idk exactly what it was) to come out, the rest of our table had already finished an lookin like it was time to undo the top button, we were finally able to get him to come out. He brought her sandwich to the table (a cold, congealed gloop of enjoyment right there) my table mate told him she didn't want it anymore, that she wasn't going to be able to eat it since everyone else was done. Without even apologizing, he told her he could get a box for her food. Didn't offer to have a fresh one, but whatever. When she said she just wanted her money back, he went to the bar (which yes, it's right next to the registers, but still) an then started talking to a customer. He then grabbed two beers out, an continued to talk to the customer for a good 5 minutes. Finally he told the owner what was going on, who then came over to talk to us like normal people, an apologized. Troy also said that he thought it was rediculous, most of the time during rushes it's only about 10-12 mins, not 30. 

Again, Troy the owner is awesome, the wait staff is rad, Sir douchenozzle is not.",4,3
"Been dying to try this place. Went with a group of about 6 , we had reservations but we still had to wait at least 15 minutes before being seated. I think that was the only downside. We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time, the margari-thai was delicious, had almost a bit of bite to it. I would get it again. My group got some appetizers to share. The chicken egg rolls were surprisingly good. As I was eating them I kept thinking how can this be so good?! I can't remember the name but the fried shrimp was really good as well. The breading was crunchy but not heavy and they had a good flavor. The Roti....oh man. Just get it. Thank me later. I got the Yuki Udon and I added cilantro. Flavor wise it was really good but I felt the noodles were too heavy. That's a personal preference as Í had never had those types of noodles. My friends had skewers and Pad Thai which was so good. Next time I would get the Pad Thai. I say all in all this restaurant is a winner.",4,5
Love this place - have been stopping here for several years on my way to work for coffee and a sometimes lunch - always friendly fast service and really good coffee,5,5
"It is noisy, the food is not that hot and, the service is even worse! I will never set foot inside their door again.",1,1
Super nice people !  Great service.  My coat was all bloody from a bike accident and they cleaned it up while I was being stitched.  I highly recommend them,5,5
The wife's favorite place as she is pregnant however I'm sure we could find a healthier alternative. Five guys makes great hamburgers.,4,4
"I called this company because of the reviews on Yelp.  

There were several positives: 1. They showed up (45 min. late), 2, They were expeditious in the whole process. 3.  The price was right ($250 / 4 hrs).

There were several negatives: 1.  Numerous items were scratched including several pieces of furniture that I had refinished. 2. When one mover carried an item, it hit the door frame of the new residence and knocked the paint off and made a sizeable divot into the woodwork. 3. They had trouble getting the washer & dryer out of the old basement.  They damaged the stairs of the old residence. The washer ended up with scratches on it. 

In the end I was grateful to have the process over with.  But would I recommend this company?  It depends.  If you have furniture that you treasure - beware.  I had even cautioned them about being careful with these items, as well as the new paint job in the new residence.  I think the scratch damage occurred in the positioning of items in the truck. Jerry shrugged his shoulders when I showed him the scratches on one item.  It wasn't until later that I saw that there were many scratches on many items.  Too late to do anything about.",2,2
"Don't let the name scare you away. We had the pork schnitzel sandwich with fries and the bratwurst with warm potato salad. They have New Orleanized the food, German schnitzel comes on a good bread with hot mustard and pickles. This had slaw instead and was on a roll. The food was good. We had a weissbier and a Bavarian ale. Very good.  I would go back. Good food and good beer. Next trip I'd probably try the jagerschnitzel.  Looking at the menu it looks like they prepare it exactly like they do in Germany.",3,4
"SLOWEST SERVICE EVER! The staff does not pay attention to its customers and are always having side conversations with each other and not waiting on their customers! Giving them 2 stars because their bagels and sandwiches are very good. So if you  are willing to wait a half an hour for a breakfast sandwich, go right ahead.",2,2
"Food: Great Crawfish! The seasoning is delicious, not too salty, not to spicy. I love it. They have a huge variety of other food, but we stuffed ourselves with 12lbs of crawfish and was unable to even move after that, so we didn't try the other stuff. So what do we do? We come back the next day! We tried their gumbo, fried rice, corn, sausage and more crawfish! The other stuff was okay,  but I rather fill my tummy with their crawfish. 

Service: EXCELLENT! The people here are so friendly and chill! Quick service! I can see myself being there all the time if I lived in New Orleans!",5,5
I went to emma's nails today and got the cutest manicure for a great price.  I will definitely be back!,4,5
"Is there a better pork bun in Philadelphia? I doubt it. And the weekly curry special is always delicious, with excellent portion size too! All in all, a stylish truck with great food, friendly chefs, and low prices. I'll be coming here much more often.",5,5
Great place. very professional and friendly. My car looked great and if I need anything in the future I would 100%  come back.,5,5
"The food is always exceptional at first watch. You can't beat it for breakfast and it is up there with lunch as well. As for this particular location the service was absolutely horrendous. Empty drinks at all times, hardly ever saw our server. Felt very rushed when they did appear. They just wanted us out I guess for more people to come in. So 5 star food but this particular location needs better staff.",2,3
"It's been a very long time since I've had a delicious and authentic beignet (ben-yay). You see, I lived in Biloxi, Mississippi for the first 7 years of my life and New Orleans was only about an hour away. We'd take frequent trips to see family and eat the amazing beignets they had in the French quarter.

But ok, enough about my stupid mini-bio. The thing is, I'm now 20 and I can't totally remember what those darn good things tasted like! There's a few places in St. Pete that claim that they're just like the ones in New Orleans, but anyone from there or who have visited would beg to differ. But to me, Nola brought my childhood back. Although being slightly smaller in size to the ones I remember, they definitely are just like the soft and warm beignets I had in my past. Once you bite into it a puff of warm air can be felt against your face because those things are hollow inside. The dough is sweet and the powdered sugar adds to the deliciousness of'em. They're decently priced and a person like me would be tempted to order more and more! I'd give this place a try if you're wondering what a New Orleans beignet tastes like. You won't regret it.

Note: They don't have a full breakfast menu. Just beignets, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee. But they do have, what seemed to be, a full lunch (and dinner?) menu. Po-boys and other stuff I forgot to look at.",4,5
Just stopped in for takeout wings and was welcomed with smiles.  Food came out super fast and were some of the best wings I've had. Overall pleasant experience and will return here again next time I'm in town.,5,5
Hanging out with friends. Nothing I can eat here other then some fried foods and salad. Meat eaters only! Lol. Great company though!  One star because it's not vegetarian friendly at all. Or if you are a health nut don't come here unless you only want salad.,1,1
"Really nice atmosphere.  Menu reasonably priced.  Had the salsa trio and queso to start.  All 3 salsas were delicious. The habanero one wasn't too spicy, move of a vinegar taste but it still was my favorite.  
Queso was hot and mice mix of flavors.  
Wife had fish tacos and she liked them 
I had Mu Shu pork tacos.  Very nice presentation and the flavors were fresh. 
Only 2 things I would do differently. 
Have fresh tortillas instead of store bought 
And tell staff not to grab slider buns that fall off plate onto the tray and pick them back up bare handed to put on sliders again. That happened right in front of our table when serving the table beside us.  
Good experience. Service was good. 
Will be back",5,4
I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. Fresh fruit cocktails and the arepas are delicious!,5,5
"Outstanding, but very formal, service and great food. Carpaccio is exceptional. The wild mushroom risotto is a don't miss and especially the authentic parmigiano to top it with. Veal parmigiano was too heavy on tomato and cheese but the tre vitello was absolutely wonderful. (Veal with three different sauces) The wine list is wildly over priced but a handful of wines (not well known) exist if you know your wines. We had three waiters assigned our table so that nothing went amiss. We did note that the jacket required is not enforced. A lovely evening and the highlight of our short visit to St. Louis.",4,5
"A little overpriced but the food is delicious. The steak frites, beef bourgignon, cheese plate and foie gras are favorites. Have ordered them over the years and it has been consistently delactable. I have only been here for dinner, which is busy but the atmosphere is great.",4,4
Born and raised on the East coast in Norther NJ. Pizza is a way of life and an art over there. I've been to several states and no other pizza place has been able to compare to NJ pizza until I went to True NY Pizza. 100% authentic and delicious! I would highly recommended this place to any and every body! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do!,5,5
This is the real deal if you have to choose between this location and allegheny this one is the one ! I love the food here if you are getting to go be prepared this place is mostly always packed to the T because hello the food is great. The dining area is very small so it's not really meant for large parties. I love getting the mofongo de camarones  so delicious. The rotisserie chicken is to die for and the pernil is great ! I love the morcilla too .  Everything is good from here if you have to get Spanish take out it should definitely be from here!,5,5
"We went here while passing through Reno on a recommendation from a family member. Well, it wasn't a disappointment! We had pizza by the slice for four people and a ""house salad
for one"" and four sodas. OMG it was amazing. The service was fast and friendly, pizza delicious and the restaurant clean. The tab came to $24. 
While I can't attest to the authenticity of the pizza as being New York style, I believe them. Cheese and toppings were generous, crust
Was crisp (partly because of the way they re-heat it in the pizza oven I think). 
Show them some love and leave a chunk of what you saved by going here as a tip and help them succeed.  It's great.",5,5
"This place is a hell on earth, and the people who work there are living nightmares.  Obviously it doesn't even deserve one star.
 
Never in my life have I been yelled at upon arrival in a place of business.  Literally berated over and over due to my percieved wrong doing by the extremly unprofessional attendant.  

I guess behavior like this is ok in Liberia, Africa, or whereever you're from dude, but you should feel lucky that I didn't punch you in the face.",1,1
Not my favorite! I've had better Vietnamese food at smaller Pho places in a mall. Server had poor knowledge of the menu and the manager did not exactly have the best custom service skills either. My dish nothing like what I had asked for or expected. Pass this one by..... Very disappointing!,1,1
"My oh my..Crabby Jack's is beyond words. I don't think this review will do its justice. You will just need to go here to understand the feeling. 

I'm from Houston, we're pretty close to NOLA, but I have yet to find a po-boy as good as the ones here. The bread is fresh and perfect. Soft but not too soft to hold the sandwich. Their shrimp po-boys are overfilling with shrimp!! So much shrimp!! Usually, I'm used to 6 shrimps per sandwich, 7 if I'm lucky. At Crabby Jack's there are probably about half a pound to a pound of shrimp!! Just look at the pictures, they do not lie. *Disclaimer: I forgot to take a picture of my sandwich because I ate it too fast.

Their gumbo is good too. $3 for a legit hearty cup of gumbo.",5,5
"Before I moved to Saint Louis I would come here a couple of times a year to visit my sister who lives in Lafayette Square.  Every Saturday that I was in town we'd walk across the park to Square One for a Bloody Mary (they make a good one and I'm really picky about my Bloody Marys) and the flank steak nachos.  It was one of our rituals that I always looked forward to.

Now that I live in Saint Louis I still like going to Square One.  The wings  and beer pretzels are great, the beer-cheese soup is wonderful, and recently I tried the tomatoes and goat cheese salad which was a whole tomato filled with goat cheese, cucumbers and basil - YUM.  I've tried many of the appetizers but haven't tasted too many of the entrees so I can't comment on those.

It's nice to have a place in Lafayette Square with good tasting beer, tasty bites, and friendly service.",4,5
"Could not award no stars or would have.  Went to dinner last night for with group of 12 at 7:30 pm.  They were out of wine glasses so we drank wine out of water glasses.  They were out of potatoes so ordered sweet baked potato and the waiter came back to our table 15 minutes later to tell me they were out of sweet baked potatoes too.  Ordered a fillet and whatever that was that I ate was no fillet. It was a piece of semi tough steak that tasted average but was not fillet. The service was very poor, though delivered in a pleasant manner, just slow and poor.  Never even looking at this place again 
when I drive by.  Brutal, horrible, horrendous service delivered by nice people.",1,1
"Overall these guys did a great job. We priced out a few companies in the city. The pricing was roughly the same for everyone but Old City was the only one to give us an itemized estimate which is why we went with them. 

On moving day they arrived on time. They moved us in about 4 hours in the pouring rain. The three guys they sent were super courteous and efficient. Nothing was broken or damaged. The estimate was nearly exact and we had no surprise charges. I would definitely use them again.",5,5
"I was traveling for work and found this place on yelp. It seemed interesting, so I thought I would give it a shot. It was very good. I had the pescado a lo macho. The fish was fried perfectly. It came with more seafood on top, shrimp, mussels, etc. and with a red sauce. The sauce was very tasty and not too overpowering with the taste of mussels. I got the alfajores to go. They were great - like shortbread cookie sandwiches with dulce de lèche filling and powdered sugar on top. The service was extremely nice and friendly. I would definitely go back to try more things if I lived in Tampa.",4,5
Pizza and Wings are always great. Def one of the better in the area. Everyone say's its expensive but for what you get def worth the money!!,5,5
"It's a nice little place Uptown. The food reminds me of Johnny Sanchez without the extra price or the headache of having to park in the CBD. The enchiladas were amazing, it's oven broiled.  Chicken mole was so good, it's isn't like the thick, syrupy mole sauce you find at other restaurants. The chips and two types of salsa (red and green) are super dank, I believe the chips are house made. As of the time of this writing, they don't yet have a liquor license, so you can bring your own wine. I want to come back and try other things on the menu.",5,5
The manager and her husband were rude and the bartenders stole money off our bar.  NEVER USE THE ATM because it takes money from your account but does not disburse.  THE MANAGERS WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT IT.,1,1
"Save the hassle and heartache and go to Adam & Eve for a better selection, better service and better quality than the expensive, defective out of the box junk at the pleasure boutique that they refuse to talk to you about.",1,1
"My 1st experience at the PBS was horrible,  the manager reach out to me invited me back and to bring 1 guest. I had invited 3 additional friends to celebrate a birthday. They covered the entire bill and provided appetizers of the most popular dishes. This is how you redeem a dissatisfied customer.  Thank you for an awesome visit. thumbs up for the PBS.",5,5
"Most of the reviews seem to be from a few years ago, so I thought I would add my two cents.

Our room was clean. The WiFi was not working when we arrived, but apparently they had to reset the router which solved that problem.

We had a flat screen TV which worked just fine. The AC unit was quiet and worked efficiently. The bathroom was clean, though the handle on the tub was very hard to turn. Looks like a drippy faucet had someone turn it way tight to stop the drip.

The noise from the highway may cause some to have a light sleep.

The price was a bit steep considering the time of year, about $90 mid May.

All in all what you might expect from a Super 8.",3,3
"Would have given 5 stars but must find a solution for the soggy bottom bun. Flavorful, cooked as ordered and served hot. While not all time best burger definitely worth the trip.",4,4
"Great pizza, little expensive but we'll worth it. The servers are awesome, always polite and asking if everything is ok.",5,5
"My girlfriend and I frequent Japanese restaurants very regularly.  We hadn't been to Yokozuna for the 2 years that we have lived here, as the exterior is not that inviting.  What a mistake, this is hands down the best Japanese restaurant we have had the fortune of visiting.  The atmosphere is very modern and still comfortable.  The service is great, so far it is the only Japanese eatery that understands what an appetizer is, and to time your meal accordingly.  The servers also checked in on us frequently, which I also find very rare for this type of establishment.  We had both cooked food, sushi and sashimi,  and it was all very good.
We are certainly going to make Yokuzuna our new regular Japanese restaurant.",5,5
"Had a great meal her with the boyfriend; we ordered lots of different things to try. I like the variety they offer, but after we sat down I could see parts of the menu that I didn't notice before, and wish I would have ordered. So make sure to look up, and read all the different signs! All the staff were friendly, and we got dessert to go from their pie shop next door. It ended up being super crowded as we left, so you may have to wait in line.",4,4
"Bland Thai food - especially if you are vegetarian.  The Pad Thai had no peanuts and tasted like it was made with Ketchup instead of Tamarind.  Our meat eating friends have enjoyed the food, but I think it's really bland and not authentic.  Instead, try Tang Thai right up the road on Ridge ave where the Roxburger used to be.  Much better, authentic Thai and you can eat in or get take out as well.",1,2
"Extremely friendly and helpful service! Prices we're very competitive and affordable. I definitely recommend this place, it has everything you need all sorts of different shampoo types as well as conditioner and ear wash. They also have a blow dryer and brushes for your dog and of course towels to dry off your dog. I always have trouble bathing my dog in a normal bathtub because it hurts my back but this is standing level and is completely comfortable and easy they even provide an apron so that you don't have to get wet at all! I will be back for sure :)",5,5
"All you can eat sushi for 20 bucks? IM THERE! Now some people say its only all you can eat for an hour. But seriously, how much fish and rice can you slam in your face in 60 mins, without hating life? If I had one last meal before I die, you'd find me here. As much as I used to be a steak and potatoes guy, my wife has transitioned me into a sushi consuming machine. We decided to check out this place while up in Reno for the weekend. My brother-in-law and his girlfriend were raving about it. After seeing pictures and hearing stories, I basically starved myself for the event the next afternoon. EPIC! Absolutely EPIC! The chef takes your orders on the fly, and doesn't stop. If you want more, order more. If you want 6 of the same thing, order it. If you want pepper crusted ahi, hamachi, king crab AND abalone at the same time, ORDER IT. Just be careful, its good enough to make you re-evaluate your life! I walked away from this place happy I didnt stick that 20 bucks in a slot machine. I was filled to the brim with food and wreaking of fish, but entirely and absolutely satisfied. If you love sushi and you are in Reno is this a MUST. My wife and I have played with the idea multiple times of making the 6 hour round trip drive just to go back and have lunch for an hour. Its that good!",5,5
Kelly has become a favorite. She takes her time and is thoughtful about the process. Happy to now be a regular patron of this lovely gem of a salon.,5,5
"This is one of those places that you drive by a lot and always think to yourself, ""We should eat there one day.""  Well, today was that day!

I ordered the roast beef panini which had red peppers, onions, and cheese on it and came with a side caesar salad, which was a nice change of pace considering most places would bring you fries or chips with a sandwich.  While the sandwich wasn't that great (the beef was a little dry), the salad was crisp and refreshing.  I had come with two friends, one of them had ordered an omelet, which she said was bland and the other had ordered the KB Burger, which looked fantastic as he scarfed it down! 

The reason for the three, considering my feelings towards lunch, is due entriely to the dessert menu.  Each of us ordered something different and each one, by our own accounts, thought they were fantastic.  I had the Kahlua and Toffee Cake which was very rich, but also very creamy and moist.  My other friends ordered the fried Oreos with ice cream, which by his drooling and hoarding had to be good, and the cinnamon cheesecake which was stuffed into a fried crust that tasted fantastic!

Overall, this place won't blow you away with their food but, if you can, stop by and get some coffee and dessert!",3,3

1,500 animals on 42 acres.  The fire was an unnecessary travesty.

With the admission price being comparable to much larger zoo's that you can spend most of a day at and this one you can go through in an hour or so, it just ranks a two star in my book.",2,2
"We had a surprisingly delicious experience here after our first three breakfast places didn't pan out in St. Petersburg on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.

With plenty of parking out front, we walked right in, debated over the menu, then placed our order at the counter.  Standard breakfast fare of muffins, pastries, eggs, omelets, corn beef hash, etc.  I had an omelet with feta cheese, tomatoes, and fresh spinach, and it was excellent.  Not too much spinach, very light and fresh tasting. Served with crazy good buttery Dome potatoes.   Plus choice of toast - I lived on the edge and had sourdough.

They have a drink station, so you have to get your own coffee, tea, soda, etc.  That is also where the silverware is.  No napkins, but rolls of paper towels are on each table.

My entire family liked their meal - it wasn't fancy, but it was very good.  Even the coffee was decent.

Pssst.. here's a secret - if you ask for your muffin to be heated, they actually cut it into pieces and throw it on the flattop grill.  YUM!

Reasonably priced, with fresh ingredients, and served hot - its great place to bring people who want a no-frills breakfast.",4,5
"I love, love, love this buffet. I loved it so much that after we had the delicious seafood buffet on Friday, I wanted to come back again on Saturday. They make the best alaskan snow crabs with big tubs of melted butter. Everything on the buffet is tasty and delicious. What really surprised me was that the new york steak was actually cooked medium rare. Most places have it overcooked so that it tastes like shoe leather. They do everything consistently well here. Even though I was totally stuffed from all of the seafood, I still gorged myself on the nice selection of dessert. They blueberry cheesecake was quite tasty as well as the cream puffs and the coconut macaroons. This is definitely the best buffet in Reno.",5,5
So I'm not from here but I needed late night food close and this was the joint everyone recommended !!! Omg!! Ohh emmm geee!! We had the people's pastrami sandwich and the frenchy sandwich they were amazing! I'm not even kidding I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the people kept cutting us in line ..but other than that the flavors though !! Yum,4,4
Love this place.  Super-clean kitchen & food prep area.  Friendly service and a wicked chocolate chip canollis here.,5,5
"I LOVE this place. It is so cool it makes other cool places seem tropical! My burger and fries were awesome, service was great and ice cream was yummy-licious. I love how that part of town is improved with new retail, coffee, etc. and especially because of Bobbie's. It had obviously stood the test of time and I hope it is there forever.",5,5
"I used to be a fan, but Mai Thai has gone downhill in recent years.  I've tried it several times lately, and, sadly, a few of the dishes were downright lame--poorly cooked or bland.
Also: if you want to sit outside, count on talking over the noise of the buses idling for many minutes at the bus stop in front of the door.  This is the stop the buses use to get back on schedule, and can be there for ages.",2,2
"Great experience.
I had the lunch special with chopped salad and Cacio e pepe.
My wife had kale salad and pasta bolognese. We started with the risotto balls.
The risotto balls were every bit as good as raved about. Creamy heaven.
I thought my chopped salad was perfect and the pasta al dente had great flavor. Wy wife raved about her food too.
We finished with gelato that had really nice texture and taste.
The service was very friendly and spot on pacing the courses.
I don't know what more you could expect.
This place is the real deal.",5,5
"I stopped by to pick a couple things up and they had everything I needed. Best part was the deck cleaner I wanted was the same price as Lowes and I didn't have to drive there! I understand the store has a new owner. We'll, whatever the issues were in the past they seem to be taking care of them. I'll be back!",4,5
Great location terrible customer service. Took my toddler in for a bang trim ...there was 3 stylist hudled in a back room and 1 stylist on the floor.  I asked if she could trim my daughters bangs she said no because she had an appointment in 5 minutes.  I explained it would take 2 minutes she then replied they were closing in 10 and I didn't have an appointment.  Zero customer service or flexibility!,1,1
"This place is beautifully decorated with delicious food. 

My only complaint is the hot toddy I ordered, which came requiring me to mix together with oddly portioned amounts of honey, hot water and whisky shot. I'd rather the bartender have mixed it for me. The staff was otherwise very prompt and friendly with their service at the bar. My boyfriend loved their beers.",4,4
"I used the NoWait app to reserve a spot in line for my party of 3. Got there 10 min before the estimated time and checked in. I asked the hostess if she still expects it to be 10 min (5 ppl in line in front of us). She said definitely.  After 35 min an employee overheard us discussing how long we have been waiting and started getting angry with us for being upset about the longer than normal wait (very rude). 15 min later we are finally seated (50 min wait - 40 min longer than NoWait) I understand being off by 20 min but 40 min and getting rude with us when asking is not appropriate for any restaurant. Good food, waitress was great but will not returning. Can't trust their wait time estimates or their employees to be respectable.",1,2
"Haven't had a dog in several years so I havent' needed a vet but recently bought a puppy and scheduled an appointment on the referral from a good friend.  To my surprise they even had something that morning but I had to decline and schedule something the next day.  The staff is indeed animal lovers and I don't think there was anyone in the back that didn't come out to meet my pup.  The staff was very courteous and the doctor very thorough and caring, he even scolded me and told me to feed my pup more which i'm sure she will appreciate.  My overall experience was outstanding and I'm sure I have found the right place to take my puppy for any health related needs she may have.",5,5
"If you're looking for rudeness and an extremely long wait (2 hours) for a haircut then this is the place to go. Their sign in sheet is a joke, because they take all their buddies first.",1,1
"We went on Monday night but the downstairs was still quite packed.  

Ambience:  Not-too-fancy, friendly, semi-casual, but would not look out of place if you were a little dressed up.  It was definitely very comfortable and welcoming. 

Food:  We ordered artichoke and spinach dip which came out with garlic bread, rigatoni D, and the baked ziti.  There was complementary bread that came with the orders as well.  We actually liked all of it.  The rigatoni D definitely lived up to its name and fame.  It was delicious.  We were satisfied with the other dishes as well and they do give generous portions.  

Service:  Great.  The food took a little while to be served but it wasn't too bad.  We had the bread and our appetizer to munch on.  The wait staff were very friendly and attentive.  One fabulous thing was they have a buy-one-get-one-free deal with the classic pastas!  If you order one of the classic pastas you get to choose on from the classic pasta menu to take home for free!  (It tells you on the menu).  That was a nice surprise as we didn't notice that deal on the menu.  Oh.  And they have nice clean bathrooms too 

We will most likely be back here again when we crave some not-too-fancy but not-too-shabby Italian.  :)",4,5
"When i woke this morning and i watched the news i saw the new process and procedures that Raymond James was doing for game. I smh and I told myself i had to get there early but of course i ran into traffic getting there. But to my surprise Raymond James had plenty of staff to get ppl into the game quickly and safely. The staff was very freindly, willing to help, and very informative. They were well trained and knew how to do there job!! Security was tight as always but everything went smooth.My son and I had a Great Time!!! #SeigeTheDayTampa!!!",5,5
I've honestly received better service and eaten better food at McDonald's. I came here with my husband and the food was only mediocre especially for the price. management was awful and the owner was incredibly rude to her employees. I will not be going back to this restaurant and I recommend you don't waste your time or money on this place.,1,1
"My wife and I both love oriental food so we decided to give this place a try.  They have been open awhile now and I figured they would have all the kinks worked out... and they do.  When we walked up we were greeted by the owners precocious and sweet daughter -about 7 years of age who showed us to our booth, and answered several questions and was more than happy to talk in general.

The owner came out to take our order for drinks (iced tea for us) and patiently answered any questions about the menu.  My wife had the Vegetable Bean Curd, Spring Roll, and Egg Drop Soup; I had the Hibachi Vegetables, Spring Roll and Vegetable Tofu Soup.  

All items came out to our table quickly, piping hot, soup and Spring Rolls first followed up by the entreés.  Quantities of the entreés was very ample, well seasoned and delicious.  Prices were reasonable 

We will be back to try their Thai selections next time.  They have Japanese (Hibachi), Chinese and Thai selections.",5,5
"I've only done take-out here so I can't speak on the ambiance and service so much

FOOD
The noodle dishes are simple and filling--it really feels like you stole a dish straight from some Thai family's kitchen. Everything is simple and doesn't try anything radical--even visually--and it works! Meanwhile, the dinners will be more familiar to American palates with their side of rice and abundance of veggies soaking in sauce. 

SERVICE
My take-out orders have always resulted in waiting behind a mini conga line of others waiting for their take-out. (The place is NEVER filled with patrons seating--I think the majority of their customers get take-out) From my view while waiting for my order, the staff doesn't know how to smile. They are constantly moving to fulfill orders, but often their silence can be awkwardly deafening while you stare at them while waiting for your order to appear.",4,4
"Rooms are clean, bars and restaurants are walking distance. Shopping about 3 miles away... Didn't give them 5 stars only because the walls are super thin and can hear everything and everyone around you.",4,4
This place was recommended to me from several people in Philly and I can honestly say that this is literally the best Cheesesteak I've ever had.,5,5
Great restaurant week menu. It's also available Sunday to Thursday before 6. The price cannot be beat. Yum.,5,5
Excellent pleasant staff with wonderful service. We went today to try them out with a groupon. They were super nice and Anderson gave me an amazing relaxing massage. They confirmed the appointment prior to the day and were very nice to talk to both before and after our massages.,5,5
"Amazing staff, beautiful venue, great layout for the bar areas.... Couldn't ask for anything more!",5,5
"I live in New Castle, about 2 miles away from 3 Country Pizza.  I personally feel that they have the best pizza in town.  Their restaurant is very clean, and their delivery services is quick.  Even on a Friday night.  I've tried their taco dish, but for my taste, they're a little bland.  I want spice with my Mexican food.  It would also be nice if they kept more cold 2liter sodas in stock.",4,4
"The food was delicious but the wait staff was absolutely exceptional. The ""token Mexican"" bus boy was on it like he was the waiter himself. The middle age Chinese lady was on top of it. All I had to do was look at her and look at her for her to know what I wanted while she waited a few others tables. I commend whoever hired those two.",5,5
"Got seated instantly at 11:00 on a weekday. My daughter ordered cornbread French toast with mascarpone, apples and walnuts. She liked it. I ordered basic scrambled eggs, bacon and home fries. No choice of bread was offered. I also had coffee which was very good. Breakfast was not good for such a basic menu item. Eggs were browned and dry, bacon was overly smoked and the texture of beef jerky. The bread was an untoasted, dry English muffin with a tiny pool of melted butter in the center, no jelly was offered. Home fries were OK but had raw onion. I will not be back. Completely underwhelming experience for the money. Waitstaff was adequate.",3,2
I was contacted yesterday by Chris W. who was kind enough to apologize. I did research to find a good barbershop which is why I chose HiEndTight. I was disappointed but we all have our days. I appreciate Chris's concern and offer to make things right. He did and in my mind the matter is closed. Thank you so much for your concern! Sincerely Mark,4,5
The devilled eggs and blue fish dip over hyped for sure.  I thought they were just ok.   Oysters were fabulous!!  If I ever come again I would come for happy hour and eat oysters at the bar.  i opted for the wood grilled lobster and i should have gotten it steamed instead.  Not that it was bad but I should have know that grilled makes for a tougher lobster.  It was good quality though and i would order again steamed !  One thing about Star he never skimps out on quality.  Decent experience but i would stick with oysters and lobster.  My friend had shrimp scampi and the sauce was excellent!,3,4
"Jules has really great thin crust pizza. These aren't classic pies, though; they're rectangles, which are surprisingly easy to eat. You walk up to the counter and pick a slice - I recommend their delicious pesto one, but they have tons of great options. You can also order whole pies. The staff is really nice, too, and will bring you your pizza when it's out of the oven. Bonus: you can bring wine and have a nice dinner italiano.",4,5
"Have been coming to this mall fairly often for yrs, nice to see the reno's but I personally don't think the businesses the management  has brought in will stand up to the community. It is getting more like a north side version of southgate mall which is high end for the most part. There are mostly families in Londonderry area which most are of modest means...don't see how they can afford the higher end stores. In the end when you look at high lease costs etc not see how this will do well. I am also disappointed to find out that with all the money put into renos there is no coffee places in the new food court, only the Tim Horton's on 2nd floor and McDonald's on main  and it is unknown if they will ever bring in any other coffee place...NOT everyone likes Timmies or McD's.  Management just shot themselves in the foot just on that basis alone. Before the renos started there were a few good coffee places ... second cup & LaPrep. Sadly won't be making an extra trip to Londonderry anytime soon....not worth the extra gas & time.",3,2
"This is a great nail salon! Been to several salons closer to me and they don't come close to this one! It's worth the extra 10 min drive.  The owner has done my nails twice (gel) and I went almost 4 weeks without one single chip in the polish!  The staff is friendly and polite! The place is immaculate and all of the equipment is top notch. If you don't have to drive, take them up on the free glass of vino!",5,5
"The staff is always friendly and helpful and accomadating. Will is great at the front desk. The best rooms are in Building 4 and get the rooms facing the pool/mountains. Gino in the Cafe is also awesome and great service. The food and breakfast buffet is great. There cocktail prices are a little high for my taste, but I guess you have to pay for the view of the beautiful mountains. Thanks to all the staff and making every stay here enjoyable.",5,5
"We went to check out The Community Counts Passport.  Little did we know when we arrived to be told there are only five downtown and three at the other branches.  
Don't bother with this program.
Also when planning a trip to the Country Music Hall of Fame on 7/29 there was a puppet show scheduled...was not available as the girl at the ticket window stated we don't know when they are playing.",4,2
"Delicious. The pulled pork was perfectly cooked and the vegan potato salad was great. The service was friendly. My only complaint was there was very, very little BBQ sauce on my sandwich.",4,4
"Best Mexican food I've ever had. Service can sometimes be slow; bring a book if you are alone or playing cards if you are with friends. The food is worth the wait though! Potato taco is amazing, so are the spinach enchiladas. 

Incredibly vegan/vegetarian friendly. I get hungry just thinking about this place! The staff are very nice as well.",4,5
"Food was great, service was good. I find it a bit nosey with the high ceilings. The waiter explained  the menu. The food doesn't come out in any order.  Curry sauce with the nan bread was wonderful.  Was not happy with the stir-fry  rice and that was the only downer to the meal.",5,4
"Dinner at Harvest with my golf partner, Melissa Tront. Filet Medallions on a bed of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus with a fig demi-glaze on the meat. Always an exceptional meal and the sunset on the Pusch Ridge mountains was awesome from the outdoor seating.",5,5
"Hands down one of the most refreshing places for breakfast in indy. Everything is seasonal, and made in house. Anywhere that serves green tea macha lattes is a place I will visit very frequently.",5,5
"I have been to the Sahara Grill two times. The first time I had the Shwarma, and the second time I had the Falafel with Hummus. Both were good, thoroughly filling, and under $8.00.",4,4
"Chicken and steak were dry and chips are not very good, qdoba actually beats them hands down on all 3.  They do have more traditional queso, but Im not a big queso eater.  I had heard good things about this place and happen to try it recently.  Trying objectively, I can easily not recommend this over qdoba or a traditional mexican restaurant.",2,2
"Absolutely wonderful pizza in there before looking forward to going back again. (During food walk. ).       Ok we were here during the food walk last week. Back again just for great pie. Saturday lots of families. Not a huge place but comfy. Order your pie, pay and they'll bring it to you. Place always jumping few times I've been here   Reasonably priced. Not where to come for wine experts. Boxed wine today. Few more choices for beer.",4,5
We were looking for a quick bite to eat and this looked like a nice option. I loved the mac & cheese with Nashville hot chicken on top! They told me this was the specialty so I had to have it. I can't say it's the best I have ever had but I would still definitely recommend it. My only complaint at this place is that there is no free parking but I assume that is to be expected. We just happened to go on a day when they were not busy at all and there was open parking everywhere so it seemed odd to have to pay for parking. I'm sure it's completely different at other times.,4,4
"A guy I work with recommended this place and specifically the war won ton soup, and he's right.  Place is great and the soup is killer.  I've been back two more times just for the soup and also have had some of their apps which were also great.  I think this place is probably more of a 4 star place on my scale but since that's my fault for not being able to branch out and try anything beyond the 5 star war won ton, they'll get the five stars for now.",5,5
"I recently completed the Puppy Basic Obedience class with my border terrier mix Damnit and found the class to be very helpful.  Learning basic behavior commands such as sit, stay, leave it, and drop it has greatly enhanced the experience of owning a dog.  Glen does a great job of explaining the why's and how to's!",5,5
"Been to the Crab Shack many times since it reopened. It has been O K, but not great. Just returned from there and it was awfull. First we sat down and waited 15 minutes before a server came by. I asked what was the seasonal Sammy and server did not know. Took her another 10 minutes to find out. Ordered food and one hour later it was delivered. All three meals were wrong. Server said they were understaffed but we noticed other tables that came in after us, got served and left while we were still waiting. Will give it another shot, but not the same server.",1,1
"What an honor to be the first review at this new local hotspot! A great ambience, complete with a full hot sauce bar of every fiery hot sauce imaginable. Nachos were an immediate win that left us scraping the plates for more -- sweet pickled onions and mexican crema really hit the spot. For dinner, we ordered chicken tinga tacos and sopes -- they were small but perfect for two in combination with the nachos. The margarita selection is eclectic. Service was a bit slow, but it may be growing pains.

The real win here is this: open till 2am, a rarity for tacos in the area.  Looking forward to many a nightcap here.",4,5
"I went here the day after the summer solstice and I have to say that it was pretty good on a whole. I went with a group of about 15 people and overall I heard good things coming from every one else at the table about their food. I personally got the fish with the bbq sauce and some lobster bisque and a pecan and pear salad. 

1st the salad was amazing and I hate salads usually so go for this pear salad thingy.

2nd The fish was good but it was a small serving size considering that this place pretty much specializes in fish and also considering it cost me 25 bucks or something like that I really expected a full plate and not something that could fit on a appetizer dish.

Speaking of appetizers, we told the waitress to just get us an assortment and she brought out some artichoke which had been grilled and that was by far the best appetizer I have had in a very long time. Everyone at the table for some reason did not eat the heart so I got that pleasant surprise when the platter came around to me :D

The other appetizers were just standard sea food fare. 

I think this place would get a four star rating from me if they did not charge so much for their food because for the quantity you get and the  just about average tastes they convey I do not think it is worth the cash.

The house beer was also good and the waiting staff was impeccable in refilling glasses and keeping a fresh supply of appetizers and such when needed.

come here for a good time, with a big group and split the bill.....the food is not in enough bulk to share and the pear salad is awesome!

oh and free salt water taffy at the door on your way out :D",3,4
"Jimmy John's is our ""Go To"" sandwich shop on weekends! Fast service, friendly people, and a funky atmosphere meld together with the fresh ingredients for that noontime refueling stop.  The bread is great!

Try the Beach Club (turkey, provolone cheese, avocado spread, cucumber, sprouts) with a side of Hot Peppers to spice it up.  Add your favorite Freebies to customize it a bit, and you're all set!

You'll likely see me there during lunch on any given Saturday.",5,5
"I love Chinatown because of great food spots like this!!! When I was interning on 12th street I asked my boss one day where I should order Chinese food from.  I said give me your favorite spot.  He told me his favorite spot doesn't deliver and that it's the only spot he goes to in Chinatown.  So we walked across the street to Vietnam to sit and eat.  It wasn't busy at the time but don't be fooled, around lunch this place is swarming with people!

Menu Must haves: You HAVE to try the salt and pepper chicken! It's amazing!  That is by far my favorite dish here! The vermicelli is good too!",5,5
"I'm not aware of a S. McCarran store. I've only shopped at the Mt. Rose Ave. store near Junkee. Because it's a chain, the website doesn't even tell you where the store is, or anything else that's really pertinent to shopping there, except a 'we're a teen to twenty-something store' statement. A bad website is also a turn-off for me, but the statement is correct. If you're over 50 ( a forty-something friend of mine likes Plato's), you will NOT find very much interesting here. I can wear tight jeans, but they're almost all tight. The shirts and tops are Cute, not a word I use about myself at my age. These are only party clothes for the over 50's crowd, and you know those are never in a thrift price range for the barely middle class. As far as selling gently used clothing, it needs to be close to designer brands or don't waste your time and get looks from the staff member who says ""sorry"". Shop on, young ones! I wore these clothes back in the day, but not now.",2,2
"A hole on the wall. But, great sandwiches.
The bathrooms suck. So, get the food and drinks and go.",4,3
Great breakfast! Pancakes were heavenly. Service was perfect. We were in a rush and she took care of us. Adorable decor. Like a soda shop or ice cream parlor. I will visit again next time I'm in town.,4,5
"A solid tapas place with all your standard spanish tapas dishes, but not the best I've ever been to.  I was really disappointed in the sangria.  I expected it to be really good, but I had trouble finishing my glass.",3,3
So far I love Bone Fish Grills happy hour. Their price range from $5-$6 a plate and drinks. I came with with a girl friend of mind to catch up on old times. My bill is no more than $20 when I cash out. I am always getting the blueberry cocktail to start my weekend. I never had the desserts but I plan on ordering them next tim.,5,5
"This is my go-to Starbucks when I have a lot of work to get done and need a good environment to work in. 

Compared to a couple other Fishers Starbucks locations this one is a little smaller in square feet but seating is more ample in my opinion, I've yet to have problems finding a spot to set up shop. 

The staff is always super friendly and take the time to notice regulars. I have never had a negative service experience at this location personally nor have seen anything negative with other patrons, even considering I've spent multiple days working in front of the counter for 12+ hours. I'm impressed.

Coffee is coffee, Starbucks quality coffee across the board. 

Pro-Tip: Bring an extra layer if you get cold easily. During the day and especially as the night goes on, it can get pretty chilly inside (which is nice on hot days).",5,5
"Came in around 1pm on a Thursday and luckily there wasn't a line! I ordered a cup of their vegan soft serve (matcha-charcoal vanilla bean swirl), which comes with a ""dust"" of your choice (I chose charcoal). The soft serve was good, not too sweet but not bitter like matcha can be when not balanced properly. 

Also, major props for incorporating aesthetic instagram backdrops along all their walls (inside and out)- it's very reminiscent of Museum of Ice Cream and other trendy restaurants you'd usually find in LA or NYC. There's seating along the back wall inside along with seats lining the outside front wall and a few benches to the side of the building. Everything was shaded so heat wasn't a major concern.

I do want to mention that the cashier at the time was kind of rude when I asked about the flavors and options, but the person who prepared my soft serve was sweet and answered any questions I had.",4,4
"If you're going to start a restaurant that does only one thing, you'd better do that one thing to perfection. Marabella doesn't really stand out to me. To top it off, my meatballs were pink in the middle. Now, I like burgers and steaks to be a little pink in the middle. But meatballs? Not so much.",1,2
My sister and I went there today after arranging my mothers funeral. I ordered Eggplant Parmesan  w/ spaghetti. The service was horrible and the food was even worse! Will never go back or recommend them to anyone!!,1,1
I am a regular customer here but as of tonight no anymore. I ordered food over an hour and a half ago via grub hub. I order the same way 2-3 times a week due to my schedule and never have an issue. Well tonight I had to call an hour after my order to check on it. Girl answered the phone and told me it was en route. Mind you I live a 5 minute drive. 15-20 mins later I call back to see why my food isn't here and then it was a fax machine issue. Pretty interesting excuse after I was lied too. Same girl answered the phone tho she claims it was someone different.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL customer service. They just lost a regular customer. Beyond aggravated.,1,1
I had dinner at this restaurant to give a tried about vietnamese food and Im disapointed about it cause they dont have the pho with everything the size is smaller than other restaurants so If you want chinese food here is good but vietnamese I recommend other place,3,2
"Love their happy hour! It's such a good deal. 

Their house wines are delicious! 

Plus their HH appetizers are tasty as well. I love their quesadillas the most. 

Highly recommend for their happy hour, which also goes until 8p! Another bonus!",5,5

"WOW!!!! Never have I dealt with such horrible service! in the past month I have made numerous calls to them. 
Call 1) Cable not working. I sat on the phone for 30 minutes and it was finally fixed
Call 2) Received my monthly bill after call 1 only to discover they charged me a $60 service call fee for someone coming out to check the equipment. NOBODY CAME OUT. after having to be rude to the they refunded me.
Call 3) I call to inform them on my move that will be taking place in about 2 weeks from the time of the call
Call 4) Come home from being out of town for 5 Days to no internet. I call and sit on hold for 45 Minutes to disover they changed my service to my new address a week early
Call 5) This comes the morning after Call 4. Guess what??  No cable again. I call and I am transfered from automated system to a human for over 45 minutes when i am ask to speak with a manager. The girl tells me she can get a manager, i cant understand her and she cant understand me. SHE HANGS UP ON ME! I call back and after another 30 minutes I speak with a manager who is very rude. By this point i have had to leave for work and I asked for them to send someone to fix the problem since I have been pushed all over with the phones, holds, and automated systems. He says it will be at my charge. I told him i refuse to pay for the mess up of the company. He says i can have somehwere here between 3-5. I said I would not be home them. Guess what? at 3:20 I get a call from Comcat saying a technician is at my door???  I call a very nice lady tell her whats going on she zaps my box again and say of does not work when i get home to call back. She also said if i was charged i need to call billing. I get home to no Cable still. 
Call 6) i call because now its been over 12 hours and nothing is fixed. I call and talk to yo ung guy who again zaps the box. He then sends me to a furhter IT desk who says they will return my call within 24-72 hours
Call 7) I get lucky. they call back within 2 hours. Once again i can not understand the girl on the phone. she does some things and nothing. She ask when she can send a technician out. I explain I am leaving today to go out of town for work but I will be home saturday and they can to the new Address ( imove this saturday) and resolve the problem. THEY HAVE NOTHING OF ME MOVING THIS WEEKEND!!!!!!!!  The lady from call 4 assured me they had everything for my move and i would have no problem when I got there. I again ask for a manager. She tells me there is not one. I raised hell!!!   I got a manager. I got a very nice one. He assuted me there will be no charge for any of this, but something is seriously messed up with my account and my move address and date. He was trying to fix it but the system was down. He gave me his private number and extensionb and ask for me to only deal with him now. So as of 9:39 this morning i still have no cable. He will call me today when he gets into the office and hopefully get in fixed.

With all this being said I have direct TV when I lived in alabama for 5 years and never had any issue. While I am waiting to get things firgured out. I am looking into back to directv ( price is mcuh cheaper too)
DONT GET COMCAST!!!!!!!",1,1
"While driving through St. Louis, we checked Yelp for the best rating for BBQ.  While at the Arch, we asked a local what they recommended and we were told Bogart's.  Yelp and this local agreed, so we went towards Soulard.  This was hands-down the BEST BBQ RIBS I'VE EVER EATEN....EVER!!  We took the Yelp reviewers recommendations and ordered the beans and potato salad to go with.  They were fabulous also.  The beans especially...with those little pieces of meat in them!  Our son had the Sausage Fatty and loved it.  The owners were very helpful at explaining the sauces.  We loved the Sweet Sauce and wish they could ship it to us in California!  We were justing driving through, but will be spending time trying to figure out how to get back to BOGART'S!!",5,5
"Vietnamese Chicken Hoagie with Cucumbers and Cilantro=delicious.  

Good prices, fresh food.  Also try seaweed crackers and chocolate pocky sticks.",5,5
"As of this writing i have only been to The SCORE once. I wanted to rent a game, but was told they have to have at least several copies of it used before you can rent it. Well the game i wanted to rent was sort of new so i was pretty much S-O-L. I can honestly say i have not been back since. However after reading all the good reviews maybe next time i'm in the market for a game i will stop back by. Hopefully i can come back and edit this review to show a 5 star.",3,3
"Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff, but unfortunately they brew up the most wretched coffee ever.",2,2
The Pho was so delicious and price is reasonable. And they have a really good BUn Bo hue,5,5
"Hidden gem.  Still working my way through the menu, but great gumbo, awesome Étouffée , and spectacular when Ron veers off the menu.  I had a ribeye surf and turf special tonight.  I am finding it difficult to want to try anywhere else.",5,5
"Agree with everyone's review. Excellent food, cheap, and authentic. My go to is the enchilada verde...fresh, light, yet filling. Tostada's are great. I also like to get the fruit water of the day. Everyone around us seemed to be eating tacos, so that's next on the list.",5,5
"This theater is historic and beautiful! They show movies, old and current. They also hold some events. Even if you don't go watch a movie, this theater is worth visiting purely for it's architecture and design.",5,5
"It's such a shame the the service is HORRIBLE at this Beef's. The location has a great, and  outdoor patio/covered ""yard game"" area are fantastic (esp. with younger kids), but the service   is ridiculous. We have been here a hand full of times hoping that we just got a bad server, but EVERY single time we've gone it gets increasingly worse. Our latest experience - A Saturday afternoon.. 9 of us sit on the patio, and are the ONLY customers, other than one table inside, at the restaurant. The waitress messed up almost all of our orders, completely forgot to input one, and blamed it on the cook. Once everyone was done the forgotten order came out, burnt , with the wrong sauce. We had 4 checks, all of which came out wrong. She added an order of $7 fries to out tab that no one ordered, and didn't take off our overcooked, hour late buffalo chicken sandwich (that she said would be taken off). So we handed her our card after she said she would remove the fries and sandwich. The copy to be signed comes out.. she didn't remove the fries OR sandwich. The manager finally comes out with an attitude. Once he hears our side of the story, he changes his tone. This was the final straw in my eyes, and we will not be returning.",1,1
"My boyfriend has talked about this place ever since we met. He was raised in tampa, unlike me, and has been visiting here for years. So i was excited to try it. I ordered the upside down banana split, WOW. The size of my head but I ate every last bit. Best ice cream treat ive had in forever....will be returning :)",4,5
Great burgers. There shake selection is vast. I enjoyed eating here and will return again. I had there butter finger shake and I really liked it. I wish we had a steak and shake here in tacoma. The next time I'm in Reno I will stop by again.,4,5
"ate here last weekend.  they were busy, but our waitress and others were attentive.  

my food was okay.  i had steak medallions.  my boyfriend had a chicken dish wrapped in bacon and he loved it.  there were sweet potatoes on the side and neither of us like sweet potatoes, but these were good.  really good.  

i would like to come back and try other items on the menu and sit in the courtyard.  they were really booked when we got there :( but i would like to go back.",3,4
"the food is good. a bit pricey, about like going to Bandana's. i live in the area and think is good when i don't feel like going far. the bbq nachos are the best. huge lunch crowd. slows down for dinner.",3,4
Awesome bar and great people. I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. The new remodel is incredible. They have flat screens everywhere and have live music on the weekends. The food is always fresh and great. Their chicken wings are the best.,5,5
"This was one of the best experiences ever! Was seated immediately, very clean, great waitress, took our order quickly. The best chef salad, had a choice of meats. Either ham & salami or turkey. He got a great looking steak. Our waitress check on us 6 times, (unheard of). The bus boy.guy was friendly and helpful as well. Just cant say enough. I will be back. Hats off to Uncle Bills, it was as good as I remember 25 yrs ago.",5,5
"I was on vacation in Clearwater last month, and this little Greek place had the best pizza.  It had a NY-style taste, but the crust was very light and fluffy.  Good cheese and the sauce was just right (not too sweet).  In six days time I had it twice.  I never could get the name right (Corner Post, Post Corner, ??) and I still don't understand it, but whatever!  It's good 'za!",5,5
"I finally got a chance to go here after a coworker recommend it highly and I understand why.

The meats are a four star. The beef is the best I've had yet. The pork is good and I've heard a lot about the sausage. 

The sides are mediocre. I don't think they make them in house  that's disappointing to me.

The service is super friendly but in traditional bbq fashion no one seems to be in a hurry even if you are.",3,4
"Went back almost a year later. No improvement. I am sadly, moving this to my ""never again"" list.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Every place is entitled to a fuck up, I suppose.  We have loved this place and have been hitting it with more and more frequency.  Last Sunday (the one before Presidents Day), there was an inexplicable delay in service that went into overtime. Extreme wait (the place emptied, people came and went and we sat and sat and sat waiting for our food).  We just about got up to leave, it finally came 1.25 hours after ordering.  The waitress was apologetic, comped our drinks and I guess we'll go back someday, just a while though....it will be some time in the distant future.  This was one helluva fall.  From 5 stars to 2.",1,2
Probably the best wings I have ever had. Just walking by and smelling the freshly smoked food is what hooks you. GO HERE!,5,5
"Love from the 1st bite! 
My friend recommended this restaurant and I made a reservation for one. I was sited in the bar area and stuff was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable dining by myself. 
Service was exceptional. Despite rush hour, I was greeted right away and server was very knowledgeable about the wine and food and gave fantastic recommendations. I ordered catch of the day with risotto and lemon butter sauce and it was absolutely delicious! Kudos to the chef who put together such an amazing flavorful dish!.
I will definitely be back and will recommend this restaurant to everyone. Outstanding!",5,5
"We're on a praline taste test mission. Laura's candies were first on the list. We went on a Sunday afternoon so there were not much candies left. The lady told us to return the next day on Monday about noon to make sure that the candymaker had delivered the batches of fresh ones. Gotta be fresh right? The ones we tried were excellent! Not too sweet and a nice smooth texture. $1.85 ($2 with tax) for one. Also tried the chewy praline which had just the right texture- not a ""pull-your-filling-out "" kind. Small little shop. We'll be coming back!",4,5
"Not bad at all! My friend and I went there for dinner last night. I had chicken schnitzel. It came with hummus, salad and pita. My friend got chicken shish (also came with salad, hummus and pita). We share some baklava for dessert and had mint tea. Mmmm, baklava was DELICIOUS. It IS a BYOB - so feel free! The service was good, the waitress would disappear at times though. The atmosphere is great, very cosy. There was no music, though, that would have been a nice addition :)",4,4
"I cannot trash talk the place, I will simply say that it was ok. I had the chorizo with cornbread and potatoes. Nothing special. I thought it was overly priced for simple basic tasting food. Do not mean any disrespect but it was ok. I will say my waiter was really good, he was over a few times to make sure everything was good, job well done and I said to him and of course tipped him well- as he deserved it. Thank you",4,3
"I love it!!! The place is really small, and when I say small, I mean 1 bar and seats 12.  The staff was very friendly and the food is great, original presentation and ingredients. The type of restaurant has nothing to do with those franchises where the food ir prepared a few hours before and stored until diner/lunch time. Everything was prepered on demand in front of you. I recommend it especially when your grabbing a bite in a casino!! Awesome!",5,5
"The food was just ok and we didn't see our server for almost 20 minutes. I had the airline chicken and it was wicked salty. We were all parched and had to go ask for more water. 

Ok for a meal in a pinch.",2,2
"Delicioso!!! Stopped by after church and we were so glad we did!

Don't let the store front look of this place get to you. When you walk in, it's pretty nice inside. You're greeted with their cashiers and tvs featuring photos of their foods so if you don't know what you're reading from the menu, you at least have visuals.

You must get their TORTAS! as the name implies.. that's what they specialize in so don't be tempted to eat anything else when you're trying this place for the first time. Their serving is HUGE- seriously. Believe me. My husband and I decided to split it and it was the best decision! When we first bit on our sandwich, we looked at each other like, ""wow. This is freaking delicious!""

We had their TORTA LA TEX MEX! It was recommended by the server so we did. Boy, was it good! The bread was killer, too! Idk how they make it but it was toasty but yet soft at the same time!


We also had their PASTOR TACO and we thought it was a bit dry. So that's what I mean when I say, try their tortas instead!

Another neat thing is that they have a SALSA BAR with different sauces! So we tried every single one of them which really made the whole experience fun.

So happy Hendersonville keeps attracting entrepreneurs in our area! Support your local businesses! Plus, their food is honestly amazing. I can't wait to come back!",5,5
"This used to be a Church's chicken. I can't say I have ever stepped inside of a Church's chicken restaurant, but Rotolo's has done a good job at making this their own. Lots of updates to make it less... yellow.

The interior is a little small, but this place is never crowded, so it works. 

Friendly & quick service, great specials, and of course, free birthday pizza if you sign up for their online club thing.

This is a nice addition to the Westbank, as it isn't expensive gourmet, but it's definitely a step above fast food chain pizza.",4,4
"Awesome little donut shop with lots of creative donuts to choose from. I think we've tried everyone they have on the menu and have yet to find one we don't like. Staff is really friendly and the donuts are made to order, hot and fresh.",5,5
"Great beer list with drafts and canned/bottled. A neat spot that's really more pub than bar with some decent looking food options. Inside and outside seating areas. But no, this is not a brewery.",4,4
"Yelp says 5 stars is ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" And I agree! Had some doubts as to how this activity would turn out. Friend booked it for 40th bday weekend festivities - we were a bunch of out-of-towners from various parts of the US. Having completed the Pedal Tavern adventure I can tell you it was a super fun time and I can't wait to do it again! Really fun way to sightsee (and be seen!). Lar-bear was our driver and was spectacular! He's an excellent DJ in-tune with his riders. I didn't bother going into the bars at any of our stops. It was fun to enjoy hanging out on the Pedal Tavern and drinking the drinks we purchased for our ride. The pedaling is not as intensive as I imagined - it's a marathon not a sprint. You don't have to kill yourself! Was worried about the cheesy tourist factor but after my first sip of beer and first 10 feet pedaling all I was worried about was ""can we do this again?"" and/or ""can we extend the reservation?"" :) Good stuff. Thanks Lar-bear and Nashville Pedal Tavern!",5,5
"Ordered 10 piece SFC Bbq and 10 piece Garlic soy with 2 pieces of corn fritters. Corn fritters were a little too sweet and greasy for my liking. The chicken was flavourful but it was a little dry probably because our order only consisted of CHICKEN BACK and CHICKEN BREAST and 1 piece of drumette. It all made sense why the prices seamed so cheap.

They're  extremely lucky to have  snagged this location, especially since the wait for your order is more than 40 mins. I will definitely give this place another chance since they do offer a few flavour options.",3,4
"I dropped my car off today for an annual inspection and this is a place I trust immensely when it comes to judgment that embody ethics.  Aaron (who I think has integrity) called me back today and proclaimed I needed two rear tires; I did not quibble.  I think this is a place that conveys exactly what you need and nothing more.  There is no doubt they have customers in their grasp because for the most part the majority of us do not comprehend the exact science of what is needed or what is not needed.  This place (I get it) needs to make money and probably takes calculated risks dictating that something is needed in order to puff their P&L, but all in all I think as auto body shops go they put their best integrity foot forward and I am satisfied with paying a premium and maybe paying for items I don't necessarily need because in the end I don't any better.  They seem and have been professional, responsive, very clean place etc etc .  I think if you value your car, you bring it here because if you are a repeat customer, you may get some dividend like they actually know your name.  In the end, get a grip, it's your car you don't how to fix it so I say trust these guys.  Safe driving people!",4,5
"Went here with a large group. The food was cheap and fine, but the drinks were a bit too sweet. The atmosphere was pretty standard for Chinatown.",3,3
"The drinks were tasty. We ordered the cheese board and split with four it was delicious but we had to order extra bread. The mac and cheese with hot chicken is very large definitely could have been split. It lacked any real distinct flavor. We loved the drinks, app and atmosphere but I would have ordered another entree. They don't take reservations so be prepared to go ahead and they will text you when your table is ready.",4,4
it was very average. the atmosphere is child friendly and its good to see mexican actually cooking the food and running things but the food itself was meh. i'd rather travel father than my neighborhood for some great food than stay nearby for this,2,3
"We had Mr. Towner out to our house last summer to fix my twenty- two year old SpeedQueen Dryer.  Work was completed in one day and reasonably priced.  (We both agreed, they don't make appliances like they used to.)  I felt it was better/more cost efficient to fix what we had than purchase something brand new that would only last six to seven years.

Two weeks ago we had Mr. Towner over to our rental property where he re-habilitated my nine year old dishwasher.  Again, the work was completed in one day and for a reasonable price.  I definitely didn't need the stress of shopping for a new machine, ordering it, waiting for it to arrive and then having it installed. 

While he was waiting for his son to run out for parts for the dishwasher, he took my stove door apart and tightened the handle down for me.  Might seem like a small thing, but I don't have to worry about it coming off in some tenant's hands now.

All in all we're very happy with the service provided.",5,5
"I go to this place a few times a month, it is a nice clean little chain restaurant. They have a good kids menu with some healthier choices, better than a greasy chinese take out place. I always order the chicken cashew stir fry with brown rice with extra kick. Chicken is tasty and the vegetables are always fresh.  The food comes out of the kitchen super quick and the staff is always very polite. Like it.",4,5
"I really miss great breakfast & diners the city use to have. It is refreshing to find a place with great tasting breakfast for a fair price. 

I don't know what their lunch taste like because the breakfast is what sold me on becoming a repeat customer. 

Their food is actually seasoned to taste. Not too salty nor bland.  The portions are nicely sized. I particularly like their pancakes & french toast. The way I judge good pancakes/french toast is when you can eat them without using maple syrup & it tastes good. 

The only thing I recommend improvement is the appearance of some of the cashiers.  Some are sloppily dressed and/or wearing hair scarves/bonnets. Its very unprofessional looking especially being the first person customers see when ordering their food.",4,4
"We ordered the mega size pizza. Mediterranean and margherita. We all agreed it was a 3 out of 10 quality pizza!!
The marinara does not have much of a flavor. It tasted like tomato sauce out of a can. The sundried tomato was chewy and was falling off the pizza. The mozzarella slices were plastic-like. Nothing authentic. It's a step up from a homemade pizza by an amateur, using Pillsbury biscuit dough.

This was a disappointment!",2,1
"Food took 50 minutes to get to our table. No joke. When it finally came out, everything was completely cold. Had to tell the waiter to reheat the food. To top it all off I found a blonde hair in my sandwich. Yuck. When we talked to the manager, she was extremely rude. She didn't try to rectify the situation but instead said, ""You found one hair out of 10 dishes, it's no big deal."" I recommend you skip this place if you're looking for good food and service.",1,1
"One of my favorite meals in the area.  I love the ahi tuna, it's like going to a sushi restaurant for sashmi. Service can be slow,  make a reservation no matter when going. The bread is great baked and very tasty!",4,5
The customer service at this Chick-fil-A is horrible I went in today to place an order for my three-year-old and waited over 15 minutes After placing my order never got my food because I had to leave to get somewhere else for an appointment very disappointed in the staff and quality of service here.,1,1
"A little pricey, but worth it. The lasagna is delectable and the menu has so much variety. My chicken Parmesan was very well made and the atmosphere is gorgeous. Owner is doing a great job and will be back!",5,5
"the pizza rolls are the best. i don't even like pepperoni. i will warn you, it's super greasy but that's what makes them good. They actually drip oil. The cheese pizza is really good too and their parmasean cheese is really good and fresh, but the lasagna is not good at all. it has a weird sweet taste. the garlic bread isn't that great either, but none of that matters because the pizza rolls are outstanding!",5,4
"How lucky did I get that the Bread Co closest to my house got a DRIVE THRU! Yep, I said it. A Bread Co with a drive thru. 

I was skeptical at first, but I gotta admit, I've tried it twice so far and both experiences have been great. Amazingly, they were super fast, efficient, and over-the-top polite. Not what you expect out of a drive thru! 

Their hazelnut coffee is my latest obsession...and now it's gotten a little easier to get my fix.",4,5
"Five stars all the way. And Troy is the sole reason why. 
Drove up to visit a friend from SD and I'm always looking for an awesome cafe to spend some time in and give my money to. Caje proved to be home when feeling so far away from home. 

Flat white to sip on the patio and it came dressed with a beautiful flower. If you're commenting on the slow service, I hope you truly understand how long it takes to draw a flower in the foam of a beverage. It's a work of art and you must treat it as such. Not to mention this was and is the best flat white I've ever indulged in. And I mean European good. 

I never visit a cafe twice when I'm traveling but I found myself drifting towards caje on day two and settled in for another flat white. Troy remembered me by face and by drink. And this time he added a smiley in my foam. Swoon. Finally introduced myself and thanked him for his hospitality while I was in town. And with the most genuine smile wished me well on my way.

So of course. Day three, just moments before I'm about to head home, I decide one last stop by Caje was in order. And without fail, there was Troy calling out orders and ending each order with ""made with love"". Double swoon.

This time he remembered my name, knew my order before it was made, drew a flower, a smiley, and whimsy hearts in the flat white foam. This dude absolutely cares. And it wasn't just for me. It was for every single person that came through with an order. 

When you find someone that is dedicated to what they do and loves it with a true passion, you have a true winner. In a place that's so easy to become so lost, you forget people like this exist. But they do. There's a genuine person waiting for you just around the corner. And he's serving up some of the best coffee in IV. Hop on your long board and just cruise on by. Trust me. You cafe experience will never be the same.",5,5
"I have visited Copia multiple times.  The food is consistently great -a hallmark of a great restaurant! 

In this review, I just to tell y'all how awesome a server David is. Knowledgable, yet freely admitted he wasn't sure what a Pimm's Cup was - hey! I prefer honesty over shallowly pretending to know everything - the Pimm's Cup they made was fabulous, by the way. And he's super comical in a timely way, not over the top, not creepy, just a great one liner at the appropriate time! Totally requesting him with the next reservation I make at this wonderful restaurant.",5,5
"The food was delicious, but we had to gobble it down quickly or miss the show at the Arden. We were seated at 12:25 and were not served until 1:35. My friend ordered a soup appetizer and that did not arrive until we reminded our server when the food finally came. Eat here if you are not in a hurry.",2,3
"Horrible service!!! Not friendly at all, very hot inside like being in a sauna. Kitchen looked very dirty and unsanitary, will never go back",1,1
"Went with my parents, sister and boyfriend.  We had a wonderful evening.  

The fantastic, very informative server was very helpful with my mother and father for ordering tapas.

The drink menu and especially the drinks were all excellent.

The food was well above par except for one or two dishes.  Oddly it was the later dishes that we were not a fan of... the earlier app dishes were very tasty!!! Esp the Buns (duck and pork)!!!!!!

But as it was a tapas place, and we ordered about 15 dishes... having only 2 dishes below average is pretty damn good!!!!",4,5
My buddy and I stop in here after going on the boat and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good and prices were reasonable (cheap for what you're getting).,5,5
"So let's start with Customer Service: that deserves a 4 star. We tried booking a room online because we were going to be in the area for my husbands aunt 60th birthday. He had stayed there 4years back and said he had a good experience. So when we tried booking online the hotel was full for the evening and we decided to call. They were very attentive and were able to get us a room for the night. Yea we got! At checkout staff was nice as well.

The actual Hotel gets a 2star on appearance. First the rooms look very run down, the room we had faced an abandon mini golf course which grass looked very over grown and when we looked towards the back of the hotel there was a weird kids pool. The smell of the hall way was of pure cigaret in a no smoking floor. The wall paper had some weird stains on them and it was pealing. The corner wall on the top right of the shower had some mold stains. The room was not even clean properly because we found a champaign top from the previous guest I think. The bed sheet had a burnt on it and there was a yellow thicker quilt which felt hard like wool material. 

TV was very small and we only had like 5 local Channels to select from. My husband was very disappointed to have seen the hotel go from a 4star hotel to a run down 2 star.",2,2
"This place better than any other Pho I have had! The Vietnamese egg rolls are fresh, the soups are Made with fresh ingredients. We absolutely recommend this place!",5,5
"Rockin' sushi joint. I'd got to say, this place is among my faves in Nola, and in general, the food is excellent, and the portions were generous. The prices just match the quality without being excessive. Every server, busker, and chef, was both nice and good looking. Overall a very quality restaurant with a beautiful accommodating staff. 5+",5,5
"We have been all over the country and tried many Indian places.  I can say this was the best we have had.  I had the Saag Paneer, my husband had Lamb Curry and was loving it from the first bite.  Tender and flavorful.  Try this place.  It's small but full of charm.  The server Ted was super nice and attentive!!!",5,5
"The sweetest staff and a very clean environment. Having this shop on campus has definitely brightened up my late nights of studying. The usual self serve frozen yogurt shop, but they always manage to have the best flavors! Try blueberry and cake batter blended. You won't regret it.",5,5
"Among fast-food, this clearly deserves 5 stars.  More notably, among chick-fil-a's this one is 5 stars.  

It's the little things.... the lines move super quickly - they come to your table and offer refills or to take your tray when you're done.  They are speedy to wipe down the tables in between customers.  

And the way they respond to every ""Thank you"" with a ""My pleasure?""  If there was an extra star, I'd give it.",5,5
"Just stopped to see if this hotel offered a reduced rate for Sansum patients and they did! I travel to Santa Barbara several times a year and the rates on priceline,hotel.com,etc were ridiculous for a wed. In March....so we just went in and asked...the room was very nice and the staff were so caring. We will definitely stay here again",5,5
This theatre is quaint. I love that teenagers are working the theatre. The staff is very polite. The theaters are always clean and the stadium seating is comfortable. The movie selection is small but rotates and covers a good number of genres. You can do a reasonable date for 2 with popcorn and drinks.,5,5
"Horrible Service. Whoever works the morning shift 11/19/16 should not be working in a restaurant. ""Heavy Set girl with brown hair and glasses"". She ran into another customer and was rude about it saying ""Jesus Christ"" and stormed off into the abyss. Inattentive to us and our lonely drinks. Had to approach her at the bar to pay for our bill since coming to our table to pick up the check was too much work because she certainly never refilled our drinks. Breakfast food was good. No complaints on the food.",1,1
"Our favorite restaurant, family owned and the food is delicious",5,5
"This is my go to place on Delmar loop when I don't feel adventurous with dining. I like to sit on the patio outside which is cozy and quiet. My favorite dishes here are mussels, chicken wings and tuna sliders. Their burgers are decent just not my fav.

They have happy hour from 3-6 Monday through Thursday. They also have a late night menu from 10pm to midnight Sunday through Thursday.",4,4
"Can we have negative stars? 
Been twice, I've never seen such horrible service! Look at the Google map reviews, 
She came out with a bunch or treys of wings, none of us knew what was what, she didn't either, the kitchen didn't label a thing! She didn't care! She said figure it out. Half the order was missing! We couldn't get a drink unless I hollered at someone! Our table was full of cups! Why can't they use a picture and refill the tea, really a new cup each time!!! There were tons of charges on the ticket that didn't belong, the manager had to fix it. The previous visit, sat for an hour and the food never came, left and went to Applebee's. HAd to go to the bar to get our own drinks. What a joke! There was no one in there! It was Saturday at 12:00 and they didn't even have the game console charged! It's obviously a pure write off and no one cares about this location, they should just close the doors. Give up, it would take some renevating and trading to get this place to par. 
Don't waste your time here, or you $$$$$$",1,1
"Ramen situation is sadly pretty bleak near Center City, but Terakawa easily stands out as the best-in-class.

There's a wait on most days, but the wait is worth it for the flavorful broth, perfectly cooked ramen and pork, and overall dining experience. 

Say yes to the ramen.",5,5
"Came looking for gyros, found a delicious house beer, fresh and tasty Greek salad with house made dressing, and some of the best gyros we've had. The gyro platter is huge. French fries on the bottom are crispy and take on some of the meat's seasoning. Delicious! We will be back.",5,5
"I have been using this store for years.  It is a busy location and anyone should know when your working on a car and you see the issue you are reparing may require a part that was not anticipated  in the estimate it adds time to acquire the part which will add to the repair time.  I mean think about it if you come in with an engine leak and pep boys said let's just put a new engine in,  a 40 buck repair would be 10 to 20k,  but you wouldn't be so inconvenience by waiting  a  hour or so while they run to another store to get an oil line.  At least 75 % of the time I have used them the estimate is higher than what I was charged. On 2 ocasions when they found a bigger issue than the estimate they called and explained in great detail why to repair it correctly it will need this additional part.  My wife drives a diesel Mecedes SUV, and they told me that a front end alignment is a more extensive process in my car and should take it to the dealership or a specialist shop dealing with European All Wheel Drive alighments, because they have the special equipment to do the job right.  They do do the oil changes on the Mercedes and use the exact oil and filter that the dealership use, saving me just under 250$ every oil change. You can trust these guys with your car. Highly recommended",5,5
"I've been to great punk/goth divey bars all over this country.  Sadly, Tucson does not have one, but the Wench is pretty close.  I'm not sure where the pirate theme came from, but it's not too overdone and easily forgotten minutes after entering.

Weeknights at the Wench are a great time to belly-up to the bar and enjoy their cheap prices and decent liquor selection.  The girls behind the bar pour well and are pretty nice too.  The food is surprisingly good depending on who's working the grill that night.  The jukebox is one of the best in town if you like rock/punk/alternative music.

The crowd here is mixed, but pretty easy going.  The black decor and the punk music isn't enough to keep the frat boys out, but they generally don't stick around long, and the punk/goth types that hang out won't sneer at you for being well dressed.  On weekends it can get pretty crowded and there's usually an event, so plan on paying a $5 cover charge after 8:00.  There's a stage in the back, but it's a small room so you may not have a great view of the band.  Oh, and it's loud.

It's not a perfect rock/punk/goth bar, but it will do.",4,4
"I usually love going to Earls, but this experience was atrocious. 

We arrived at 630 and were seated in the bar. It was about 10 minutes to get drinks and another 10 before we could order. We ordered our food and then were basically abandoned for an hour. Our drinks were refilled, but my friends ended up with a weird floaty in it. There was so much ice it was basically a two sip drink. 

We had no update on our food for an hour, and when we finally got one it was that our food was just being plated. We received our food and it was dead cold. My chicken sandwich was soggy at the bottom from sitting and the fries were cold to the touch. My friend, who ordered a bacon cheeseburger with no bun due to a gluten allergy, received a basic patty on lettuce with some mustard and mayo on the side. No bacon, no cheese, no vegetables. My friend with chicken fingers had none of the sides or sauces she ordered. We didn't see the server until we were nearly done. 

In the end, the lack of service and the poor food made me decide not to return here. I may try another location, but not anytime soon. I couldn't even find a survey on the bill.",1,1
Amada is fantastic. Brunch or Dinner...it doesn't matter bcuz both are extraordinary. The Scallops and Steak from the grill are unbelievable! Pick anything off the menu and you won't be disappointed.,5,5
"Despite the Bucs' and USF's losing streak, going to Raymond James Stadium (""Ray Jay"") is always a good time. Traffic and parking around the stadium on game days aren't too bad. The facility is always clean and I feel safe being in it. The only thing is that Raymond James is an outdoor stadium so it can get quite hot in the Florida heat.

The best part about the stadium is the pirate ship, of course. The cannon is fired once for each point scored. I haven't been on the ship yet, but it's fun being near it because throughout the game people on the ship would throw beads, t-shirts, and other free prizes to the people below.

So even though most likely I won't see a winning game, it's still more fun watching a game from inside Ray Jay than on tv.",5,4
"This is by far the best place to eat in the mall. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious, must go",5,5
"I needed a last minute shoe shine for a wedding in Santa Barbara and found De La Vina Shoe Repair through Yelp. I was greeted by Bashir who was almost going to close down for the day. However, he took me as his last client and provided me with very friendly and fast service and a quality job at a good price. He helped give me that extra sharpness I needed for the wedding! Thanks!",5,5
"Really excellent traditional Bosnian food. The dishes were freshly prepared and served very hot. The music at construction of the restaurant are reminiscent of old European towns. 

We had chicken and sausage plates. The three of us had a great experience.",5,5
Another wannabe new Mexican restaurant that has terrible food. Nada going to go back. You'll be wise to avoid.,1,1
"I'm new in town so I came here because of the reviews . I knew I was going to get the pork fried rice .I didn't really look at the other stuff on the menu .I got a shrimp egg roll . That was pretty average.It tastes like a spring roll ,with maybe three baby shrimp in it.The  pork fried rice is kind of  average also ,not bad not Excellent. I guess I'd come here again, but I would try a few other places out first.",3,3
"Though I haven't been in here in a long time, I always had a good time and found it to be a chill, neighborhood bar atmosphere that becomes a little more poppin off on the weekends. Their crabs are also a bet.",4,4
"This place is absolutely disgusting. Biggest mistake I made was not researching before booking. The ""no smoking"" room reeked of tobacco. Looked like the room hadn't been cleaned in ages and cigarette burns on the linens. Also, they charge you a $50 CASH deposit that I was not made aware of until arrival. Honestly this motel doesn't even deserve half a star. Please save yourself and stay elsewhere.",1,1
I love the food a lot . Very nice. But those Chinese employees don't have manners . They lack a good customer service.other than that I enjoy the food. I don't care about customer service I just want what I want and go,1,4
"I hate to say it but we were the only customers, the ""homemade chicken soup"" seemed like it was microwaved from a can and the pesto cream pasta with chicken had an extremely small amount of chicken and very plain.",2,2
"I love this place! The food is amazing, reasonably priced and the staff is incredible. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for great food and atmosphere!",5,5
"Truthfully now and be honest, there's probably nothing better in life than getting up early on a weekend as the sun is just peeking through and heading down to your favorite local diner for breakfast.  If I'm alone, it's a sit at the counter kind of day.  If I'm with others, a table will do (I do love the counter though).

I normally get just a simple 2 eggs over medium with hash browns, toast and coffee so we're talking very simple.  Not hard to make and they usually get it right.

I wish I could do this everyday, makes me want to retire early and just head to Spencer's for the morning routine.

I do think they should shut down for a few days during a slow season and clean the place though...it needs it.",5,4
The Shrimp and Eggplant stack were AMAZING! I also had the Fried Alligator Nuggets. I have only had these at chain-restaurant Pappadeaux's so that's the only think I can compare them to.....they blew theirs out of the water. So darn tasty!,5,5
"i had the hoodie sandwich today. IT ROCKED !!!!! this place is the BEST ! the chocolate chip cookies are to die for as well !  Great FAMILY run place with great food and reasonable prices. i have to go back on a saturday when the have BABY BACK RIBS.  best sandwich i have had in a while. I had a GROUPON deal there, and drove one hour to get there. IT WAS WORTH IT !  this place is out in the middle of no-where !!! beautiful country side, go slow or you just might pass the place !! ENJOY !!!!",5,5
"I went to a Place called WineO & ATE like a FoodO! Yum..

 I notice most of the bad reviews are from a while ago- thinking something must have changed because my husband & I absolutely loved the place!

Tried it here for the 1st time to get a bite before a concert at the Electric Factory..

Don't be fooled by appearances. My husband confessed when we first walked in he was wondering what I got him into. Upon entering, there was a guy standing out front smoking, a couple dudes at the bar & 1 table of people eating. I guess it looked too much like a bar fly place to him which he is most definitely not.  
Hubby's tune quickly changed after talking with the charming hostess & our friendly waitress, Brooke.
We ordered & were told our choices were excellent & we ordered delicious plates. This was very true! !! Everything was EXCELLENT!! Can't wait to go back. 
Only downfall- they have ruined Calamari for me from everywhere else... 
SERIOUSLY- GET THE CALAMARI!!!! BEST EVER! the aioli sauce is out of this world & it is also served with roasted peppers... Ok my mouth just watered! Time to go back to WINEO!! :)",5,5
"To quote Veronica Corningstone from Anchorman, ""God no, it smells like, like a used diaper... filled with... Indian food.""  If Indian food were any grosser looking, I'd still love it - especially if it's from Tiffin.

I recently took a trip to London which to my surprise was the Curry Capital of England.  I was shocked at how many Indian restaurants there were - literally two or three to a city block... maybe that's an exaggeration - but a lot.  We tried a few out there and none compared to Tiffin.

I've never ordered and had it delivered, but apparently it's so ridiculously busy that the man on the phone will tell you, ""Ok, give it about an hour and a half.""  If I'm craving it, I need it faster, so I always pick it up.

The pricing is fair, maybe a little on the high end for ordering take out but everything is so delicious that it's worth it.  My suggestion - Lamb Saag.  If you're worried about the price or have been to Tiffin a few times and want to try other Indian food, go to New Dehli.  It's at 40th and Walnut, 10% student discount, $11 per person buffet and the deserts are like none I've ever had.  We usually get the honey balls... probably because I think it's funny that I ask for balls for desert.  Man... I'll never grow up.",5,5
"This place is simply amazing. The food is always great, the atmosphere is very chill, and the staff is amazing. My boyfriend and I love bringing a bottle of wine here and ordering a bunch of rolls. Plus, the seaweed salad is so yummy! I highly recommend this place.",5,5
"We stopped in for dinner earlier because we were in Valley Park. We are BBQ snobs and we love to find new places. We have been to both Bogarts and Pappys. Dalies may be a sister restaurant but the sisters are not twins. We ordered a pick two plate with pulled pork and ham, a pulled pork sandwich, and BBQ nachos. The meat was tender and well cooked. However, for $16.00, I would expect a much larger portion of meat on the plate. I decided to make it a sandwich to be more filling and once I folded the bread, I couldn't even see the meat. It was disappointing. Also, the bread would be so much better if buttered and toasted. The fries were also over-done. The fried pickles were good but they were made with sweet pickles, which is quite a different taste.  The nachos were very good and quite filling. They were spicy and the perfect amount of toppings. The restaurant is clean and the service was fast and courteous. The sauces were delicious and full of flavor.  We may try this place again if we are in the area but I won't make a special trip.",3,3
"Amazing sandwiches (vegan and non alike), local produce, garden in the back... Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I stumble across BBQ sauce with GHOST PEPPER in aisle 3. Now people, of all the amazing stuff this place has, what you really want is this life changing condiment.  Just go, now. During open hours of course. You can thank me later.",5,5

"Modern looking food  preparation. Not greasy. 
I guess all the rave reviews like bland food.   I tried it a second time and said very spicy. 
Still it would barely have made the ""mild"" rating for most store-bought sauces and salsas.",2,2
We've been there a few times and each time the service was excellent as we anticipated it would be. The food was very good.,4,5
Fish and chips are the star. Pot pie was probably authentic but just ok. Roast beef was disappointing. Server dude was efficient if unengaging. I will come back any time for the 5 star fish and ships. If we all had fish and chips would have been a solid 4 star review.,3,3
"we posted this in november and to our surprise, it was taken down. we didn't realize that reviews are edited out., we we are posting again to see how long it stays on the site.  2/10/12  posted.  
Wow, did we eat at the same palce as some of the other diners? As perspective, we have eaten at garces, fond, talulas garden, bistrot la minette in the past month and found them all to be yummy and graceful and flavorful.. .. This was not. Our waiter bordered on surly, banged down our bread, very abrupt, slow. We ordered the pear goat which was absolutely yummy. Our farmhouse platter was bland. The cheeses and meats were not introduced to us but they were really unremarkable. Brie was bland. The blue cheese was great. Pate was good. Can cured pork go stale? We both thought one of the prosciuttos was really hard to chew and tasted off. And we LOVE the pig. Bread was grilled (gas?) and was burnt so much it overwhelmed all else. Also had the escargot bean stew..escargot were ok but the dish was really underseasoned and the beans were al dente and the watery stew had no flavor. Finally, beef brisket... Okay, but not melt inyour mouth tender, fried green tomatoes were encased in a greasy hard shell and really unappetizing and the pink cold cabbage draped onthe cabbage didn't match or add to the dish. So disappointing. The narrow dining room is cold (literally and indesign). The bar is beautiful, convivial and hopping, drinks looked fancy and fun, but our eating experience left a lot to be desired! How did this get 3 bells in 2006 ish?",2,2
"I hate this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I avoid it at all costs and will actually not go see an artist I LOOOOVE if the show is here.

As everyone else has said, the parking is TERRIBLE!  The sound is TERRIBLE! This place is a huge headache for me.",2,1
"Wow. This place is where it's at. You get greeted with smiles, handshakes and hugs!  Picked up a 2017 LX570. Great car!!  Staff was super helpful.  Thanx Yahya who sold me the car and didn't hesitate answering any of my concerns about making my decision. Thanks to James Porter and Alex  Ayyoub who helped seal the deal. And can't forget Sam in finance who took care of all the paper work. All in all, nice homey feeling from this dealership. Brought my kids and nephews with me, and no one said a thing about them eating all the snacks or drinking all the complementary beverages  in the waiting area or a when they were checking out all the showroom cars(hand smudges all over the place).  If I'm ever in the market for another car, I will definitely plan a visit.",5,5
"Dario was an amazing tour guide. My 8 year old and I did the ghost tour- it was age appropriate for him. I loved hearing the history of the city, as well as the haunted tales. And going in the haunted cafe was so fun! I don't believe in ghosts but I did get an interesting picture that makes me wonder.... tip: we bought a groupon (in line for tickets!) to save $28!",5,5
"This place is great!! The staff is extremely nice. They have all your fishing needs like neon night crawlers, minnows, kayaks, tackle, and more. You can even get your fishing license there. They also have some hunting gear like crossbows and tree stands.

I work with kids and I always bring them in there, the staff as well as the customers are always nice to us. They even told me about some local fishing spots.",5,5
"We just got delivery tonight (we live in Bella Vista). It was on time and still piping hot when it arrived. Everything was delicious; chana saag, lasooni naan, dhaba chicken. Also came with a huge container of rice, a free bean soup, mango chutney and spicy sauce.",4,5
"China King on Oakhurst Rd, Largo, FL, is our favorite. I like egg rolls, crab Rangoon, Terriaki Beef, pork fried rice. Wife likes SPICEY Veggie Rice.",5,5
"Enjoyed the yummy potato skin hash and coffee for breakfast.  Had been to the Carpinteria location years ago and not having been impressed have not returned. But, since it's been quite a while and this new Goleta cafe recently opened, I gave it another try. Much different opinion now; quantity is not a big deal for me, but the portion was so big, I now have breakfast for tomorrow and the fresh daily baked scones looked terrific.  Will definitely order one next time. The adjacent room through a little passage was also a pleasant surprise and I will dine there next time. It's a basic ambience, so if looking to impress someone go someplace else, but if you want nice service and good food with no pretense this is fine.",4,4
The hoagies are delicious and the prices are even better. I will definitely be coming here for sandwiches on the regular,5,5
Food I always fresh healthy and great!  I love the cabbage salad and also the lamb kabobs.  The fries are delicious!  You must come meet the wonderful owners Anissa and samir!,5,5
"From the moment we walked in for lunch on a Thursday we had a great experience. Service was great. Thanks to the yelp reviews we got the mac and cheese topped with hot chicken and it was everything we wanted to eat during the couple of hours we spent in Nashville on our way to Paris, TN.  I had some moonshine and my boyfriend had a beer. Great staff, very attentive and very tender chicken and cheesy mac and cheese lol. win for all!",4,5
"Drive-thru moves quickly and the staff is friendly.

I tried their sausage/egg/cheese/english muffin breakfast sandwich recently and it was delicious.  In fact, it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had, period.  Very surprising.",4,5
"Love Nudy's Cafe - we've come for breakfast and lunch, always leave having a great experience and wanting to come back for more. Their breakfasts are one of my favorite in the area. Definitely give Nudy's a shot but be ready to wait for a table if you come for breakfast/brunch because its a popular place, and rightfully so!",5,5
"Okay, I never complain about service because I know how hard it is for local businesses to thrive and grow, but this is a restaurant that needs to shut down. 
I've never had a worse dining experience in my life....and I eat out a lot.   When we arrived, no one greeted us.  We stood at the entrance to the restaurant/bar
area and watched as several of the waiters chatted with the bartender and ignored us.  We felt like we were crashing a private party.  When they finally acknowledged
our presence, they took us to an outdoor patio that had several dirty tables.  They told us we could sit wherever we liked, actually pointing out some tables that hadn't 
even been cleared yet. We were given menus and left alone (no water offered) while our waiter went back to cavort with his buddies at the bar (this went on all night).  
He would come over and give us bread or our drinks etc. and then disappear back to the bar for long periods.  It was late---8:30 pm and only about 3-4 tables were occupied. 
When the waiter came to take our drink order, we asked if there was a wine list.  He hesitated then said, ""well, we had a wedding here last weekend and we're out of most of our wine"".  
Um, what?  You don't purchase more wine to serve your guests after a wedding A WEEK AGO?  Okay, fine...let's try to enjoy our evening anyway even though it's becoming
a farce.  ""Well, what red wines DO you have?"" we say.  Waiter says, ""we have a Woodbridge cab or a nice table wine.""  We say, ""okay, bring us a bottle of the cab.""
Then the waiter hesitates and says they don't have bottles, just carafes (huh?).  We agree to the carafe.  Waiter comes back to the table with a glass of cab saying he's so 
sorry but this is all they have left and if one of us would like it, it's on the house.  OMG!  At this point I asked my husband if he wants to just leave before we're 
trapped in this hellhole all night.  We had a chance to look at the menu and it was a joke.   Husband says, ""no, let's make the best of it.  It'll be fun to laugh about it later.""  
Back to the goofy menu.  It wasn't organized properly so it was hard to read and there was very limited selection.  The entre section had several pasta dishes (written
in Italian with no translation), then there was a separate ""pasta"" section as well.  There were a few different seafood medleys all served over pasta, a pork dish, a chicken dish, 
veggie lasagna, pasta bolognes and some salads....that's it.  We were left to contemplate the menu, without being told about any specials.  When the waiter came back to take 
our order we asked if there were any specials, he says....""oh yeah, stuffed meatballs.""  Ugh!  We ordered from the menu.  My husband's seafood medley included scallops that he said
tasted like bait you might put on a hook to go fishing...downright foul.  He was afraid it might make him sick.  My shrimp (over pasta) wasn't as bad, but it was overcooked and rubbery.  
We ordered some broccoli rabe to share that was inedible.  It tasted like burnt gasoline.  We could not get out of there fast enough, but unfortunately our waiter was
MIA so it took forever to get his attention (from where he was hanging out at the bar) to get our check and leave.  To top off this wonderful evening, the ink on our check was so faint
we could hardly read it (the only light being candles on the patio).  We had to take the bill inside and hold it under a lamp.  I don't have one good thing to say about this place.  
Terrible food, terrible service.  Unless they do a 180 degree turn in service and food quality, they will not remain open for long.",1,1
Such good food and great prices! A really good environment and clean restaurant. Highly recommend!,5,5
"Company was contracted by my son's landlord to trim a tree.  Company gave no notice of when they were coming out.  Appeared while my son was at work and proceeded to cut the tree --ONTO my son's car causing several thousand dollars of damage.  Company left no note and informed no one.   After multiple efforts a meeting was arranged at the site with the landlord and ""Ed's"" to review the matter.  Ed's failed to show up.  My son had to file a police report and now has to contend with insurance claims etc.  This company is a scam!  They apparently don't have insurance.  They have no licenses that can be found.  I can't give them zero stars as much as I'd like to.",1,1
"While in town I stayed @ the Hampton Inn West End. I was by myself missing my family back in KY, and decided I wanted to get a little local experience with coffee and nibble for breakfast instead of the typical hotel breakfast. Especially since it in on the same block as the hotel!

I read the reviews, I knew I was going to walk into a tiny grocery store and then a coffee house.  walked about the little store and it was small and quaint. The selection was very limited. The magazines were a mix of mainstream mags, beside some artsy fartsy stuff (that I love) like Ad Busters. (Need at least one photography mag).

I loved the selection of speciality beers and the ability to create your own six-pack! This place attempts to cater to hipsters, and they don't do it in aces, but come on as long as someone is trying I'm fine with it.

It always makes me worried when you walk into a store and nothing is inviting with the signs, signs everywhere are saying, ""Restrooms ONLY FOR CUSTOMERS"", ""$3.00 MINIMUM!!"", etc... I understand some places have to post this stuff, but art it up! Not some cheesy laminated hand written sharpie marker!! It's not that had to care for design.

So, I met the bar tender and he ask what would I have... and I did what I always do... I want the best drink for a fat hairy guy, cold, espresso, and some flavors...

(side note.. now I know several Starbucks friends that hate customers that do this.. they just want me to know what I want to order and order it... but... I live a life desiring others to dream about the possibilities that this life offers them.. so when I ask this guy what would be good, that I trust him... that my taste buds are in his hands.. but not literally because that would just be awkward. 

He asks the usual, Soy? Whole?.. So this is what he comes up with... a triple soy, honey cinnamon iced latte! This thing was delicious:! It was Karma Sutra in a cup! AMAZING! I have a new favorite drink! But, check this out....

He pulled the shot (not need for latte art here it's iced) and then measured out the honey, added the soy to the cup level then grabbed the cocktail shaker! and shook the whole thing up poured it back into the plastic glass and toped it with one more dash of cinnamon. VERY good. The Lemon sunshine muffin was just fine too. 

The atmo of the coffee shop is very open exposed brick, big wall coated in crushed velvet made to look like a big stage (maybe it is, not sure) (a scene right out of Moulin Rouge!). The music was a classical radio station from Portland (I remember thinking man, I wish the weather was that pleasant here, but I could almost close my eyes and wish I was surrounded by mountains enjoying a coffee. 

All and all, it was a very fine place to spend my morning waiting to leave for a flight. 

Pros: sweet little hipster grocery store.
Con: needs a little more refined design, and could use a photo mag.

Pro: atmo of coffee house was nice and coset, very quit and good temp.
Con: stop yelling your rules at the customers with sings... (but the sign on the tip jar was AMAZING!
Con: classical music is not bad, but a little out of place.. lets get some acoustic coffee house music up in this mug! Maybe a chill set from Mumford and Sons? Joshua Radin? The Champion and His Burning Flame? Come on this is Nashville for goodness sake!",4,4
I LOVE the hearty quinoa bread. You wouldn't know it's gluten-free! I keep it in my freezer and usually toast it up for a breakfast treat.,5,5
"Just gave this place a second try hoping that our poor service was a fluke. I'm sad to say that today's service was even worse. Our waitress had one other table because it was before the lunch rush but she still managed to forget our appetizer. Drinks were messed up and were initially given no time to look over the menu.  We had to listen to the kitchen staff yelling and laughing from behind the window. 

I'm giving two stars because the food was pretty good. Not the best presentation but it was still tasty.",2,2
"The bathroom was horrible it smelled bad and the shower was disgusting. The hanging TV in the pictures is actually just a normal stand TV hung up on a wall, i really didn't care but it was a cheap move. Also i thought i heard squeaking but don't take my word for it, it was late at night and the TV was on. One of the only good things i can say truthfully is it had good free wifi and a cool alarm clock.",1,2
"Stopped by here for about an hour or so on a rainy afternoon. It was well worth the $6 entrance fee. There are three floors of NOLA history, which in my opinion is some of the most fascinating U.S. history there is. Especially intriguing are Napoleon's death mask (one of many anyway) and the various oil paintings of famous New Orleans residents.",4,5
"I love this Florida craft beer bar! So cozy, bar tenders are friendly and helpful. I wish there was more then 1 food truck just to have a choice of food. Overall a great place to hang out and get good quality beer!",4,5
"Got a dress here a couple of weeks ago. After going to another store and being told by the lady she would be back by 4 and to come back (what kind of business does that in the middle of the day) it seemed like fate that we found this place. We called and got an appointment right away. There was no pressure and the lady was extremely nice. She had a fairly good selection. I was out of there in 15 minutes with a dress I absolutely loved, I tried it on and just needed a few alterations, over all I give it a 5 out of five stars. If you want to get a dress without spending a ridiculous amount I recommend déjà vu!!(:",5,5
"I confess. I'm a sucker for girl power and all that jazz.

I was first introduced to Go! Spa for a blogger party and fell in love. I loved it so much I joined their Groove Club. So, you'll see me once a month for either a mani/pedi combo, massage or facial.

The have quite the selection of OPI polishes and always have the latest and greatest colors. They have super comfy chairs for the pedicures, and they are none like anything you've had before.  

Everyone is nice and friendly. I feel like all the gals that have done my nails we go into some deep and meaningful conversation about life, family kids. So not your typical spa!

So 2 thumbs and 2 toes up!",5,5
"Absolutely delicious - just discovered this place and it's worth the little extra drive to get here.  Yes, I would come out of my way to eat here.",5,5
Manager tried to give away my branzino to his friends that came in after us.  We strongly objected and he never came to the table to explain the problem. Never going back there. Food is mediocre at best. Owner shows preference to his friends. Does not treat all customers the same.,1,1
"""This place is like a Mexican Hooters."" So said my 65 year old uncle after we were seated this evening at Sir Veza's. Not having been to Hooters myself, I defer to his judgement for that comparison. 

I normally go for tamales at Mexican food restaurants, but as soon as we walked in and took in the atmosphere, I could tell that Sir Veza's isn't your usual Tucson authentic Mexican restaurant. Due to the number of TVs turned to soccer, baseball, etc, I think it is more aptly described as a sports bar serving Mexican-inspired options. So, even though tamales were on the menu, I decided follow my uncle's style and order the fish tacos. In addition to the two tacos, the meal came with a side of rice and re-fried beans. I thought the blackened salmon tacos that I chose were spiced nicely but I preferred the grilled fish tacos that my dinner companions ordered. Each meal cost about $10. 

While I'm glad to have tried the place, I found it hard to hear my family over the noise from the TVs. Luckily for me, this is Tucson and my Mexican food restaurant options are nearly endless...",3,3
Unbelievably rude attendees and this is that like cannot believe that they close at the beginning of the season at 8 o'clock and refuse to serve the 50 people waiting in line,1,1
"Man, I was all prepped to be blown away - and I just wasn't.  Pastaria gets great reviews, and the food critics love it.  But my dinner was really just okay.  Or maybe I was overly expectant and so my impression was negatively impacted by that.  Regardless, reputation & expectations do affect the star rating.

The restaurant setting itself is enjoyable enough.  It is a big, single room with tables all closely packed and a high, industrial ceiling.  So the noise level is high.  This isn't a problem, but rather how it should be for such a setting.  Service was adequate.  Staff checked on us with the necessary frequency to clear plates, fill glasses, etc.  I drink gallons of water (almost literally), and our server did a good job of keeping me filled.  However, nothing was said regarding our very long wait between salad and entrees, such as ""the kitchen is quite busy,"" or ""it should only be about [xx] more minutes.""  No suggestions for particular pastas or entrees were offered, which isn't a big deal.  I did ask for one, and the server gave me her recommendation, along with her reason (basically cured hog jowl = good).

We ate with another couple, all each ordered salads - except the other husband who had a side of Brussel sprouts instead.  Salads were pretty good, if also pretty standard for any decent restaurant.  And while the restaurant was full, it didn't seem overly busy - yet our salads took about 10 minutes to arrive.  And then the real kicker was that our four pastas took nearly another hour after the salads to come to our table.  The pastas were pretty good for the most part - except that I was really disappointed with the cured hog jowl.  It seemed pretty darn sparse in my bowl.  part of it may have been because it was diced so finely that it was hard to see.  But when I did look for and find it, it really wasn't that flavorful.  I do have to say, though, that my wife's shredded pork with her pasta was nice 'n tasty.  And I must give a shout out to the gelato desserts.  Interesting flavors and rich, creamy texture.  Yum.

Oh, I almost forgot.  You are served a single slice of really good, hot dense bread.  And that's it.  So we ate our slice of bread (with oil & parmesan), ate our salads, and then sat there & talked for nearly an hour until the pastas came.  I was especially sad because as I watched all the other diners getting their single slices of bread, I realized that ours had been about half the size that were normally served.  Gyp!  We finally did ask for another slice of bread to go with our pastas - because it wasn't going to be offered.  And those slices were normal size.  Whew!

I know this sounds like a cranky review, because it is.  The food was good - but not great, top-tier-restaurant-in-St.-Louis-rating quality.  I can't be mean and give a 2 star rating - ""Meh, I've experienced better"" is too low.  And I suppose it was ""A-OK"" overall, despite my grumbles.  So I'll settle on that.",3,3
A group of us decided to go to New Orleans for the weekend and we were told that dragos was one of the best restaurants. I ordered the shrimp fried platter and got catfish as well. They were able to split the platter half shrimp and catfish. It was pretty good. I think the next time I would like to try something different. We had an awesome experience.,4,5
"Service been improved a lot 
It became my second favorite DD
That's the one on black horse bike",5,4
"If you want a soft baked pretzel you can't go wrong by stopping at this location in the in the mall. Since they got rid of the glazing raisin many years ago (which was my favorite), I usually get the cinnamon sugar pretzels. During this trip the pretzel bites were coming out of the oven so of course I got those instead of the regular pretzel. It was a great snack and they were hot and fresh out of the oven. I quite like the bites because they are easy to eat on the go and much less messy. 

I also got mine free, to see how check out my post on the blog (penniesinmypocket.com).",4,5
"My wife and I had our 2nd wonderful dinner experience at the Sprig & Vine.  Besides  the oil and salt, we thought they were tremendous vegan menu items.  We arrived at opening (5 pm) on a Wednesday and we're the first patrons seated.  Not surprisingly, we had excellent service since that first hour and a half was rather slow.  The waitress had time to recommend dishes and help us make choices, which was helpful and added to the experience.  Our first dish:

EDAMAME FALAFEL............................................................7
black sesame tahini | pickled radish
 
This appetizer was great, both the falafel and the tahini sauce - we both enjoyed the dish.  There is a photo of the appetizer w/in the review pictures.  As far as the entrees:

GARLIC & TAMARIND-GLAZED PORTABELLA............................20
fried green tomato | green tomato chutney | apple, 
avocado & cashew raita | butternut-basmati rice | 
coconut & green chile-creamed swiss chard & chickpea

ROASTED CAULIFLOWER STEAK ...........................................20
tomato, garlic, caper, green olive & herb sauce | seared
potato pavé | golden raisin & pine nut-local greens

The greens (swiss chard?) w/ the raisins and pine-nuts was very tasty and well prepared as was the glazed portabella.  Sadly the glazed portabella was on top of a bed of basmati rice.  We really would have preferred brown rice - or at least the option.  Although the criticisms are truly minimal, since we really enjoyed the meal.  We finished w/ a delicious tiramisu.  It was splendid - when you have sugar, you don't need milk or eggs to make an amazing vegan dessert.   The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant stylish - an overall charming experience.",5,5
Love this place! Driven by 100 times but never noticed it--now I go almost every day. The homemade peanut butter protein bars are a staple and The Doc smoothie had me hiking Ranier 4 days after surgery and jogging after 10!! The staff is friendly and helpful--I can't say enough good things.,5,5
"Chef MA is an amazing chef! He greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome. The establishment isn't what you would think of for an iron chef winner's restaurant, but it is a small, simple, humble restaurant where the emphasis is on the food, not the building!",5,5
So disappointed!  I have been here multiple times and it's normally great... I got a gorgonzola walnut salad....That came with no dressing...and ordered a sandwich that was cold (not supposed to be)... The santa barbara location is 100% better than this!,1,2
"This might be the worst restaurant in the ENTIRE Ba area.  I went to Chill for breakfast with my fiancé a few weeks ago.  The service was abysmal!  They were slow and the staff did not say hello or greet us for almost 5 minutes... They were busy joking around with each other.  Ok the service was the good part!  I had an omelet and it was more like scrambled eggs with a bunch of toppings.  My fiancé had a $12 breakfast sandwich that was terrible.  We asked the waiter about a substitution possibility and he just kept saying the chef will not do this.  I will say if there is a Chef in the building he is probably the one from the muppets!!  Please avoid this place.  We live in walking distance from Chill and we WERE excited about trying this place.... It is overpriced, food and service are terrible!",1,1
"Last Saturday, a group of friends and I walked over to the Mill for brunch. We were quickly seated and provided menus. The bus boy was extremely friendly to our table and continued conversation through the meal, which was great!

After delivering waters to our table, the waitress arrived. We were greeted by two waitresses - one who was in training and her trainer. They were both extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations. 

We ordered a combination of the chili rellenos, the turkey/roast beef special, and the sausage & waffle benny. We sampled each others and no one was disappointed.

After completing our meal, we were quickly presented our checks, due to the busy volume of the restaurant. 

We enjoyed the ambiance and menu items very much. We definitely will be back!",5,5
"Drinks, beach, music.  Food pretty much sucks, but the aforementioned totally makes up for that.",5,4
"5 stars for the desserts, minus 1 star for the terrible boba tea.  Come for the various asian desserts, which is their specialty as a bakery.  Anything with red bean is what I tend to prefer, but I think pretty much all the desserts here are good.  Workers are knowledgeable, can tell you what's inside or maybe describe the taste if you're not sure what to get.  Individually priced and cheap enough for you to try different ones to see what you like best. 

DO NOT get boba tea.  Making boba tea drinks is not their specialty.  I got Taro tea with boba, I can't even even describe why it was bad, it was just the worst I've ever had, could only take 2 sips before deciding to throw it out.",4,4
"I'm not prone to handing out 5 stars, but Criollo deserves it. Any time I go to New Orleans I eat here, twice. Maybe more. You just won't find a better meal, and in NOLA that says a lot. Their scones, and mushrooms, will bring tears to your eyes. The stuffed Grouper is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, and I've eaten all over the world. I cannot say enough about this wonderful restaurant. We have friends in NOLA who had never been here, it is in an area most locals avoid. We insisted they join us, and they now take visitors here. I like the fact that it is not famous like other restaurants. It makes it easier to get a table. Do yourself a favor and eat here. Twice.",5,5
This is the best smoke shop I've been too! Don't believe people who say it's bad customer service! The guy is amazing and funny and the place has anything you want from a book of matches to the greatest accessories! Prices are very low!,5,5
Ate here about a month ago with two of our friends. The service was enthusiastic and accommodating; the entertainment and atmosphere was fun and definitely a throw-back; and the food was reasonable though didn't wow us. My wife's scallop entree was a little lackluster. Overall a decent experience.,3,3
"If I could give them zero stars I would. How can you run a shuttle and limo company that services the airport and yet close at 5 PM. Better hope you don't have any problems after 5 or you too might get to endlessly listen to a recording promising help as soon as their operators are not busy.  At 53 minutes my husband hung up, I tried their online ""chat"" and messaging with similar luck.",1,1
"really nice inside, can get a decent beer at some of the stands... and non decent beer as well... bud had some crazy stand where it shoots the beer up through the bottom of the cup. whoa! 

it's a clean venue... bathrooms were well kept...  i wasn't so impressed with the ""chickie and petes"" fries which apparently were supposed to be the *BEST FRIES ON EARTH*. but that's not the wells fargo center's fault, right?",4,4
"Ok. Let me start off by saying that I've been in Tucson a while, and I've eaten at the previous location (Alvernon/Broadway).  The old location did not put the restaurant in any advantage in anyway; parking was horrid and the building was becoming very dated.  However, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was always worth it.  Now that's out of the way... The new location is one hundred times better, but it doesn't make the fattest, ugliest elephant in the room seem less blatant-- the service.  The server was very unhelpful when it came to questions about the sushi.  Someone accidentally tipped their glass of water over... ""oh, are you guys ok?"" No.  Five minutes later. ""oh are you guys ok?"" Ok seriously? get your rag and wipe it up now.  Or at least give us napkins.  It doesn't take five star service training to get that down.  And the sushi was a rip off.  NO MEAT.  Sorry, this experience was very disturbing and made me think...

Where the hell did the service go? Where was the friendly staff?  Yeah i get that the government helped you to hire more people, create new jobs, etc.... BUT PLEASE... next time use your time wisely and use our government's money (my taxes) wisely and hire people who know/want to work.  Please and thanks.",2,2
"Besides the inventory being a bit cramped and having an unorganized lounge. I have nothing but nice things to say about this place. Good service, quick service, and decently fast trades n sales, with far far better return ratios than a GameStop.",5,4
"Our family loves Hoods!  I was mistaken to think this was going to be a BBQ joint only.  Of course the BBQ is fantastic,  but they have a wide variety menu that is great. Love the salads and they are huge! The dining area is always clean as a whistle, and the staff is extremely friendly.",5,5
"We were here on Christmas Eve morning, so it was a little surprising that we got seated right away--albeit at the 'community table,' which is okay for 2 people. Half & Half opened recently in the space vacated by a First Watch restaurant, which is a pretty good, standard breakfast and lunch chain. This new place is much more expensive, and Webster Groves is likely a good neighborhood to peddle high-end breakfast food, so I wanted to try it. I had a sausage biscuit. The biscuit is a little strange, a crumbly texture inside a dark shell, a flavor more reminiscent of challah bread than a biscuit. The sausage, made in-house, was more like a hamburger patty, with little spice, little of the flavors of pepper or sage that one associates with sausage. If that's all the better they make sausage, they should buy a good premium brand. It had an egg on it, with aioli, which was kind of jarring, and I asked for it without the (nearly ubiquitous) cheddar cheese. I was fairly disappointed. My friend had the house standard bacon and eggs. The over-easy eggs were nicely done, and the house bacon was flavorful, though it was cooked way too crispy for my taste. Both plates came with a huge heap of pretty standard fried potatoes. I always see heaps of fried potatoes as a sort of culinary rationale--sure, we're charging you $13 for a sausage biscuit, but look at that heaping plate of food! Mostly potatoes. We both had coffee, though once the server had served it, she never returned to fill our cups, which I regard as an egregious error in a breakfast place. At this point, I can't see a reason to return, especially when one pays over $30 for breakfast.",2,2
You can really taste the care and love put into every house made ingredient...so good!  Went there tonight and will be back for lunch tomorrow!,5,5
"My newly ringed fiance and I, both decided to celebrate our engagement at this fine wonderful Italian restaurant. Being of Italian and Sicilian descent, myself, I was expecting the best, and received it.

The hostess greeted us with a smile, and seated us almost immediately. They asked if we were celebrating something special, and all Diane did was show her the ring, and the rest was made wonderful for us.

Staff kept coming by the table to congratulate us, servers did what servers do and everyone helped everyone else. The food, we chose was Northern Italian style, and the veal did not disappoint. It has to be the best in the city. When I go out, I want something different that I cannot make at home, and they certainly did not disappoint.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who desires authentic Italian cuisine, Italian service, and an atmosphere where everyone feels like they are part of the family. I will be posting positive reviews wherever Benedetto's is listed. Well done, everyone! Tutti al tavalo da mangiare!",5,5
"I created a Yelp account solely for the purpose of commenting on the biscuit,amazing.
2 for 1 beer specials was pretty nice too.",4,5
"I went looking for some action on Saturday night, and ended up at the Strip Joint.  Disappointed when I arrived, I settled for some steak (kidding).  

I had the Steak Maison and fried pickles.  I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in the fried pickles.  The batter was too bready and soft.  The dipping sauce that came with it was good but not enough to save the dish.  The steak was decent and overall with fries and a salad, it's a value but I prefer the steak frites at Good King's Tavern for $15.  There was nothing particularly memorable about the meal. 

The place is cozy and service was friendly, but I don't see myself back in this establishment unless circumstances put me there, ie. someone wants to try it, we're in the area, SideCar is too crowded, etc.",2,3
"Great Breakfast specials. Pick 4 items for $5.79. I got 2 eggs, 2 bacon slices, 4 pancakes and coffee. It was all great.  Other items include,  ham, grits, toast.",5,5
"I know there are lots of Nashville Hot Chicken joints in town, but what I love about Bolton's is that they have the chicken (not too greasy and seasoned just right), but they also have catfish.  OMG, it was the BEST catfish I've ever had.  I ordered it medium because I wanted to be able to taste the catfish and it did not disappoint.  Some of the other reviews mention that it's located in a less than desirable neighborhood, but it's totally fine.  So it's not Brentwood; big deal.  The staff is friendly and the food is fast.  This place is awesome.",5,5
"i got a late night delivery from TOTT and i was so disappointed. i got two cheese steaks, mozz sticks and cheese fries. fries were soggy, sticks were cold and the steak was dry. i was so sad.",2,2
"Fabulous food, atmosphere, full to the brim drinks, delicious prime rib sandwich and the best fries ever, all with great service to boot!",5,5
"Natürlich kommt man für den Peanut Butter Bacon Burger hierher und es ist wirklich ein Erlebnis! Erstaunlicherweise bildet die Erdnussbutter die perfekte Brücke zwischen dem nach Wunsch gebratenen Fleisch und den kleinen Baconstücken. Dazu gibt's noch einen Salat oder eine Ofenkartoffel. Kein Ahnung wie man diese schaffen sollte, da der Burger doch recht schwer im Magen liegt. Das ist es aber wert!!!
Die Atmosphäre in der Bar ist entspannt und man sieht viele interessante Leute.

Ein Muss in New Orleans!",5,5
"Food is delicious!  Definitely try the family style pork chops on Sunday and, the family style fried chicken on Tuesday!! Patty is the best waitress!!  Always have a great band on tap as well...",5,5
Staff was nice and funny! There's not many options to choose from but hey at least we get unlimited toppings and the ice rolls were great! The chocolate one is perfect for any girl who has sweet cravings haha,5,5
"A friend and I came here on the Nashville stop of a road trip. Being from the west coast, I really wanted to try catfish at some point. The Stillery cooked theirs perfectly! It wasn't too greasy but wasn't too dry. I hoe stay loved it and wish I can get catfish more readily in LA. 
The mixed drink I ordered was delicious and dangerous-I drank it all in a quick second. 
My friend wasn't feeling well and ended up just ordering fries. The waiter was very nice and even asked if she was okay when she stepped out for air. 
I would definitely return on a future trip to Nashville. It was right next to a bunch of bars so it was the perfect first stop for a night out.",5,5
"Amazing food! Highly recommend the Boston Clam Chowder, Scalop Risotto, and Spicy Cajun Jambalaya. Great bread too!",5,5
"This diner has really gone downhill.  I ordered baked stuffed shells (probably not a smart diner choice but I was in the mood). Sauce (or gravy as they call it in Philly area) was like watered down tomato paste cheese was not melted and was more like glue than melted mozzarella. My husband was so-so on his cheesesteak. We hadn't been here for awhile because our last time was pretty bad, now I think we're done with trying. Oh-I bought a pastry on the way out. Another disappointment.",1,1
"Incredible theater! Charming, cozy in clean with a friendly staff and unique events. HIGHLY recommended for a private event or chill night out.",5,5
"I have had take out from this place twice now. Both times we had the Kalbi short ribs, and the coconut shrimp.

First off the macaroni salad is tasty and creamy, and goes well with the salty sweetness of the meat. The side salad that I got was fresh and had little chunks of pineapple in it which was a nice change.

The ribs were thinly sliced and very tasty. They had a smoky flavor and a sweetness that you don't find on other ribs. There was also some teriyaki sauce on the side that I would use to dip once in awhile.

The coconut shrimp was pretty standard although very good and not greasy. Everything was cooked perfectly and I would definitely come back here again.

I want to try the chicken katsu and the kalua pork.",5,5
"When you talk about dive bars, Gaslight Inn fits the bill. It's not much to look at from the outside and there's not a lot of parking. There's nothing fancy about the inside. But wait until you try the food.

I make it a point to try as many breaded tenderloins as I can, and I have to say that Gaslight Inn's version is my favorite in Indy. They don't press out the tenderloin as much as every else does, so you get a thick, juicy sandwich that doesn't disappoint.

Also, talk with the owner and employees about the ghosts that roam the restaurant. I'm not kidding you about this one. The stories they tell are endlessly entertaining.",4,5
"Good food ample serving. Omelette was excellent
 Hashbrowns were more like a potato pancake. Clean nice friendly and prompt service. Price was typical but no bargain. Will return again.",3,4
Food was good but we waited a really long time to be seated and then to be served. Not rushing back when there are so many places in NOLA with great food.,4,3
Came at 2:30 during their 24/7 drive thru and they would not serve us???? Whattttt. Help. Literally called an Uber so they would take us through drive through and they won't take us.,1,1
So I needed orders for COPD Awareness and I called my local printers and check on line...Rush Order is by far the most adorable and professional company I have dealt with for tshirts. The tees not came out beautifully but the staff are wonderful. They are helpful and keep you up to date with all the steps from design to delivery. It was very personal and I really appreciated that. I would recommend them and use them again. Thank you Rush Order!,5,5
"First time here and will be sure to come back! My flat tire was fixed in less then 15min for a very reasonable price! Very nice customer service! Cleaned my rear windshield off the snow , since I didn't have anything to remove it with (:
A+++",5,5
Used to go to kitchen bar a long time ago when they had 10 cent wings on Mondays. Ended up here on a humbug with one of my besties and I can't figure out why we stopped coming. I Definitely enjoyed the crab wantons. Didn't really know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. They were delicious. The cheesesteak spring rolls were also pretty good. My friend had the crab benedict. She wasn't in love with it (asked for her eggs poached hard but that was overlooked) other than the eggs being not to her liking she felt that they just sliced her English muffin and didn't toast it. But she said the crab with the spinach was pretty good. Also had the handmade chips. They presentation wasn't all that and they tasted how they looked. Somebody might like them but I wasn't a big fan. Overall my experience was pretty decent and want to go back to try the pesto mussels. The meal wasn't to bad on the wallet and I was full when I left so no real complaints.,3,4
Good meatballs and cheap drinks.  The draft beer is always extra cold.,5,5
"Amazing atmosphere, great staff, they serve Impossible burger which is also way rad. Good place to go for Vegans and non Vegans alike - attentive service, great booze.",4,5
