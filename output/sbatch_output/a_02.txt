Searching with Lmod:
--------------------
  All searching (spider, list, avail, keyword) support regular expressions:
  

  -r spider           '^p'          Finds all the modules that start with
                                    `p' or `P'
  -r spider           mpi           Finds all modules that have "mpi" in
                                    their name.
  -r spider           'mpi$         Finds all modules that end with "mpi" in
                                    their name.

Handling a collection of modules:
--------------------------------
  save | s                          Save the current list of modules to a
                                    user defined "default" collection.

                                    "name" collection.
  reset                             The same as "restore system"
  restore | r                       Restore modules from the user's
                                    "default" or system default.
  restore | r         name          Restore modules from "name" collection.
  restore             system        Restore module state to system defaults.

                                    user's "default" if no name given.
                                    ===> Use "restore" instead <====
  setdefault          [name]        Save current list of modules to name if
                                    given, otherwise save as the default

---------------------------
  is-loaded           modulefile    return a true status if module is loaded
  is-avail            modulefile    return a true status if module can be
                                    loaded

Important Environment Variables:
--------------------------------
  LMOD_COLORIZE                     If defined to be "YES" then Lmod prints
